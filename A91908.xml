            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Much Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He experience that I have of your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and ingenuitie, emboldens me here to prefix your name, not from any worth in the worke performed on my part; but in reſpect of the ſubject mattter of this book, which is a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that mutuall intercourſe and viciſſitude of divine love, paſſing betweene Chriſt, and the Church his Spouſe; ſet forth by a moſt ſweet and comfortable, by a moſt excellent and raviſhing Allegorie, of a <hi>Marriage-Song:</hi> Marriage being the moſt joyfull paſſage of all our life, and a Song being the higheſt expreſſion of joy; by
<pb facs="tcp:118024:3"/>
this amiable reſemblance, is the ſouls ſpiritual conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, moſt lively delineated: Oh! the ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min nt excellency of divine love; tis the glorie of God, the joy of his heart, tis the fulneſſe of Chriſt, his Crowne and dignitie, tis the worke of the Spirit, in all its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tis the Song of Angels, and their continual delight: tis the ſourſe and ſpring of true happineſſe to all Saints: the Sanctuary and ſupport of their dejected ſoules: This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Fathers boſome, draws forth the affections of Chriſt, and melts mens hearts into each others; the ſweet ſenſe whereof is the breath of our noſtrils, and the life of our union with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noble Sir,</hi> I have but three words to ſpeake, The firſt is, of you: the ſecond, to you: the third, for you.</p>
            <p>That of you is to teſtifie, that as the Lord hath called you to high and honourable imployment, ſo he hath raiſed your Spirit ſuitable to the worke in hand; wherein you ſtood as a Rock immoveable in the middeſt of ſtormes and tempeſts, having (like <hi>Obed-Edom)</hi> owned the Arke, when few would owne it, ventring all that was dear unto you, accounting godlineſſe the greateſt gaine, when others have reckoned it their loſſe, eſteeming that your honour, that others have deemed their ſhame. Though it be granted, that Truth needs no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron <hi>(veritas ſtat in aperto campo)</hi> being better able to ſupport, honour, and advance us, then we can that, yet thrice happy and bleſſed are they that owne it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more you engage for Truth, the more will truth dignifie and advance you. Whatſoever you expend for Chriſt, in Chriſt you ſhall find it againe, and ſhall receive your owne, with the greateſt advantage. The Philoſophers expreſſion of good is, <hi>Bonum eſt-ſui communicatum:</hi> Good is communicative; the more good therefore you
<pb facs="tcp:118024:3"/>
ſhall expend, the more ſhall you diſcover a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of goodneſſe to dwell in your heart, flowing from the fountaine of fulneſſe, diſtilling from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And that you have engaged me with many undeſerved favours, I ſhould be ingratefull either to deny or forget them: though I cannot make you a retaliation, <hi>(Nihil dat quod non habet)</hi> yet that you may know, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ner forgotten in a thank full breaſt, give me leave to preſent this as witneſſe, and teſtimony of my gratitude to you-wards; being confident you will receive it. as I preſent it, with the ſpirit of love.</p>
            <p>That to you is, that you would fix your affections upon, and let the whole ſtreame of them runne unto that only delectable, and love deſerving Object Chriſt, who is the glorie of all delights, and abſtract of all praiſes. Its the nature of true joy, to delight it ſelfe in ſome ſolid good, and there is no good can be compared <hi>cum ſummo bono</hi> with that only chiefe and eternall good, that is treaſured up in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When wee ſuffer the creatures to ſteale away our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we not only loſe the right uſe of them, but thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave our ſelves of true comfort in God, render our ſelves diſhonourable in the eyes of good men, and unprofitable to our ſelves: for though the creatures may ſerve us, yet they cannot love us; tis only Chriſt that can make ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes of love, for our love. In which gracious manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of Chriſt, our hearts are made a Spring of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, a garden of ſpirituall delight, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of heavenly joyes, the treaſure of divine comforts, and by the impreſſions of that heavenly love, and the ſweet glimmerings and flaſhes of light, life, and glorie in Chriſt, our ſoules are abundantly refreſhed, and ſatisfied,
<pb facs="tcp:118024:4"/>
as with marrow and fatneſſe. Then (Sir,) this will be your Crowne and glory, this is that will heighten your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ennoble your minde, enlarge your heart, and make you moſt acceptable to God, precious in the fight of men, and exquiſitely carry you through your weighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi> (that excellent Sonne of wiſdome) that his heart was as <hi>large as the Sea,</hi> viz. in judgement and underſtanding: ſo ſhall your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wiſedome, and underſtanding be enlarged, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the largeneſſe of Chriſts love living in you. The Jewes were to offer thoſe creatures in ſacrifice unto God, which the Nations worſhipped for their God: ſo though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men fall downe and doe hommage to the creatures; yet let it be in your heart, to ſacrifice them all unto the Creator. Surely man is never more ſtraightned, then when he is bound and pent up in the narrow compaſſe, and ſcantineſſe of earthly things: for let his heart ſtoop ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo low, the World fals beneath it; and let him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the world to the greatest height, his heart is ſtill above it. But in relation to Chriſt <hi>(cujus contrarium verum eſt)</hi> the matter is farre otherwiſe: for when mans deſires and affections ſoar never ſo high, as an Eagle; ſtill Chriſt is above them, fils them, anſwers them, yea he doth exceedingly heighten, enlarge, and abundantly ſatisfie them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall conclude with a word for you, expreſſing the deſires of my ſpirit on your behalfe: that the Lord would be pleaſed to fill your precious ſoule with the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding riches of his love, grace, and favour, and cauſe his glorie to ſhine upon you ſo, as to transforme you into the image of his glorie: that the ſweet kiſſes of Chriſts lips, may be more precious to you, then fragrant wine, and his
<pb facs="tcp:118024:4"/>
name then the richeſt oyniment, that the ſenſes of your ſoule may be more refreſhed with his redolent ſweetneſſe, and filled more with his redundant fulneſſe, then withall the moſt delightfull things in the world; yea, that Chriſt would pleaſe to lodge all night betwixt your Breaſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually dwelling in your heart and affections, and that he would come into your ſoule, as into his garden, to eate his pleaſant fruits, his honey, with his honey-comb; and to gather his myrrhe with his ſpices; that by his divine influence, your ſoule may be filled with all the aromaticall fruits of the Spirit: And laſtly, that you would caſt down your Crown and glory at the feet of Chriſt, who will be the glory of your Crowne here, and your Crowne of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie hereafter.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly compared, and called after the moſt holy place of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he built; for this ſong of ſongs, or moſt excellent ſong reſembleth the Holy of Holies, or the moſt holy place.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of this Song was <hi>Solomon's</hi> marriage with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter, who was a ſtranger by birth from the Common-wealth of Iſrael; yet ſhee became a Proſelyte to the Jewiſh religion, as you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118024:6"/>
may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10. <hi>Hearken (O daughter) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and incline thine eare, forget alſo thine own people, &amp; thy Fathers houſe.</hi> By <hi>daughter</hi> here is meant the Queen, mentioned in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. which did figure out the Church, or the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem, the Lambs wife,</hi> Rev. 21. 9, 10. So that herein <hi>Solomon</hi> was a type of Chriſt, admitting the Gentiles into communion and fellowſhip with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now it was the manner of old, at Eſpouſalls and Nuptials to ſing <hi>(Epithalamia)</hi> love-ſongs, or ſongs of betrothings: this is then, without all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, a ſong between a Bridegroom &amp; a Bride, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in divers perſons are brought in, uttering their parts in it, but eſpecially two, which are Lovers, betrothed each unto the other. True it is, that the Bridegroome and this Bride are not named by any proper names in all this ſong; but it is moſt cleare and evident who they be, by thoſe excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions which are made of them. For the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is deſcribed to be a King of that tranſcendent and moſt excellent ſhining glory &amp; majeſty, which none hath attained unto but Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the moſt high God; and the Bride is deſcribed by ſuch rare beauty and glory, which farre ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the glory of the world, and cannot belong to any but to the Bride the Lambs Wife, mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 7.</p>
                  <p>Again, how ridiculous and abſurd would it be for any to think, that this ſong was penned by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to expreſſe his owne affections to <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter, or hers to him; in reſpect of thoſe ſtrange compariſons, liking the Spouſe to <hi>a company of horſes in Pharaoh's Chariot, her bed to Carmel, her eyes to Fiſh-pooles,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118024:6"/>
her noſe to the tower of Lebanon, her teeth to a flocke of ſheep,</hi> and the like: this ſong therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth farre above all earthly reſpects of worldly marriage, being a declaration of the bleſſed and ſweet conjunction between Chriſt and his Church; and of that contract and eſpouſals made between them, whilſt the Church is here on earth.</p>
                  <p>It was the ancient manner, that the parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending marriage were betrothed, and after ſome diſtance of time the marriage was ſolemnized: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time of their betrothing, and of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing the marriage, tokens of love and favour did uſe to paſſe between them: but when they are married, the Wife is received into the neareſt ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Husband, and becomes a partaker with him of all his riches and poſſeſſions, his glory and dignities. Thus it is with the Lord Jeſus, he hath betrothed himſelfe to his Spouſe here on earth, and at laſt the marriage ſhall be ſolemnized, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 7. So that all thoſe riches and dignities the Church now receives in the promiſe, then ſhee ſhall have the fruition of them.</p>
                  <p>We may further take notice, that it is not unuſual in Scripture, for Chriſt to be called the Bridegroom, and the Church the Bride, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5. <hi>As the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over thee.</hi> And again in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>I will marry thee unto me for ever; yea, I will marry thee unto me in righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>I have prepared you for one husband, to preſent you as a pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Wee have it from Chriſts owne mouth in <hi>John</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Hee that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom: but the friend of the Bridegroom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118024:7"/>
which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegrooms voyce.</hi> By theſe Scriptures it is plain, that Chriſt uſeth this ſimilitude of marriage, to expreſſe his love to his Church.</p>
                  <p>In this ſong here be divers perſons brought in, uttering their parts; ſometime ſpeaking, and ſometime ſpoken to: and alſo the Bride makes mention ſometimes of her <hi>mother,</hi> and of her <hi>little ſiſter.</hi> It was the manner of old, that the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom had young men to be his companions or friends, ſuch are Angels and Saints unto Chriſt, ſuch were the Prophets and Apoſtles: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was termed of himſelfe to be one of Chriſts friends. Alſo the Bride had Virgins to be her companions: theſe are called in this ſong, <hi>the daughters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> And touching the <hi>mother</hi> and <hi>ſiſter</hi> of the Bride, they are both meant the Church of Chriſt; for it is the manner in the Hebrew tongue to call the whole the Mother, and the parts thereof the Daughters and Siſters: now there is but one univerſal Church, and therefore called the Brides mother: but the Church is never whole in the world at one time; and in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes conſiſting of the <hi>Jewes</hi> only: the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which was not then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is called her <hi>little ſiſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the carriage of this ſong is ſuch, that it doth as well recite the moſt diſmall and ſaddeſt paſſages of the Church, as thoſe that are good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet, leſt any thing might darken this marriage ſong, the ſaddeſt paſſages in it are made ſweet by ſome amiable reſemblance. The Church ſometimes moſt of all deſires a neare communion with Chriſt: at other times ſhee declines in her affection againe:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118024:7"/>
after this ſhee recovers: Yet again, ſhe declines in her affections, till at laſt Chriſt draws her nearer in affection to himſelfe, by diſcovering his own love to her. Now in theſe intervails and changes which the Church went through, ſhe met with much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction, which is declared in this ſong, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the joy and comfort ſhee found in the enjoyment of her beloved.</p>

Firſt, <hi>The Church and ſervants of Chriſt have alwaies matter of joy and ſinging;</hi> theſe only have the true cauſe of joy, and their joy ſhall never be taken from them. The joy of carnall men is nothing but mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 2. Believers only have true and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid joy, flowing from the ſpirit of Chriſt within them; they onely can ſing, <hi>making melody in their hearts unto the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, note, <hi>That the Church can rejoyce in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well as in proſperity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> can ſing of his deep waters and calamities, as well as of his great mercies and deliverances: and the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes:</hi> Not only in times of proſperity and mirth, but alſo in times of adverſity and diſtreſs: the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Saints are not ſo many, or ſo great, but ſpirituall joy will mitigate and overcome them all. Afflictions are turned into matter of rejoycing, when they are a meanes to ſtir up our faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mans reconciliation with God by Jeſus Chriſt is matter of great joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Booke treating of mans reconciliation with God, and of his ſweet conjunction with Chriſt, with joy in the holy Ghoſt, is called a Song: yea, it is a marriage ſong, a ſong of betrothings. Now what paſſage of our life is more ſweet than that of marriage? and what ſweeter expreſſion, then by a ſong? It thus is ſet forth unto us the ſweet conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the ſoule and Chriſt. It is the nature of joy to delight in ſome ſolid good: now no good can be compared <hi>cum ſummo bono,</hi> with that chiefe &amp; eternall good; it is no wonder then, if the ſoul doth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118024:9"/>
much rejoyce to be joyned to Chriſt, who is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry top of all felicity and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, obſerve, <hi>How the Lord takes all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to win our affections unto himſelfe.</hi> He preſents before us the pure, free, perfect, eternall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant love of Chriſt towards his Church, with all his incomparable and heavenly riches, wiſdom, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and graces by that amiable and pleaſant, that ſweet and comfortable allegory of a marriage ſong; to the end, that he might carry up the ſoule to things of a divine and heavenly nature. The holy Ghoſt doth many times frame arguments moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the nature of man, as that in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love,</hi> &amp;c. That is, as if the Lord had ſaid, I uſed arguments ſuitable to mans nature; I did not uſe violence and rigour, but rather choſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them with mercy and loving kindneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the tranſcendent excellency of this ſong.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſong of ſongs:</hi> That is, the chiefeſt and moſt excellent ſong; for by doubling of the words, the Scripture uſeth, when it ſpeaketh of good things, to underſtand moſt excellent things, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>The Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords.</hi> That is to ſay, moſt high <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God:</hi> and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if it ſpeak of baſe things, it doth on the other ſide by doubling debaſe them as much, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>A ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be.</hi> That is, he ſhall be a moſt vile and baſe ſervant. In like manner it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 16, 17. <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> That is, the moſt high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty King, and ſupream Lord of all. The doubling of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118024:9"/>
the words make an Hebrew ſuperlative, by which this is noted to be the chiefeſt ſong.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, of all <hi>Solomons</hi> other ſongs, for hee made a thouſand and five, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 32.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, of all other ſongs in Scripture: <hi>David</hi> was the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael in his time, and had his golden Pſalms; beſides many other ſongs there be in Scripture, and all of them very precious: yet this ſong excelleth them all, and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe this ſong ſpeaketh of Chriſt's love to his Church, and the Churches love to Chriſt more largely, ſweetly, and comfortably then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſong in Scripture: and by ſuch allegories and amiable reſemblances, taken from the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſtatelieſt things under heaven; the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, thericheſt, and the moſt precious things that are found among men, as the richeſt Jewels, the ſweeteſt Spices, Gardens, Orchards, Vineyards, Wine-ſellers, and the like: theſe with the like ſet forth and expreſſe the ſpirituall and heavenly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and Jewels which Chriſt beſtoweth upon his Church, with the fruits of her love to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſong admitteth more variety of interpretation then any other: ſome underſtand it of the Catholicke Church, ſome of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from <hi>Solomons</hi> time to the laſt judgment, ſome of the mutuall affection and love betwen Chriſt and every Believer: We deny not, but that there may be uſefull truths in each one of theſe interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but ſure it is, that all, or the moſt paſſages of this ſong will very well agree to the ſpirituall ſtate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118024:10"/>
of the Church in every age of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The difficulty and hardneſſe of this ſong, which ariſeth from theſe grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſodain change of the number, tenſe, and perſon, as now ſpeaking ſingularly, then plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; now in the preſent time, then in the time to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that there are ſeverall perſons ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, now the Bride, then the Bridegroome, and ſometimes the friends of them both, <hi>viz.</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In reſpect of all thoſe parabolicall and enigmaticall phraſes and dark ſpeeches, wherein is contained very divine and heavenly matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> had this ſong in ſuch reverence and high eſteem, that none of them would read or ſtudy it, untill they were thirty years of age.</p>
                     <p>Now foraſmuch as this ſong excells all other in the Scripture, in that it celebrateth the myſteries of Chriſt and his Church, and the conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, more amply and excellently then any other;</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, <hi>That this ſong of Solomon is a moſt excellent portion of canonicall Scripture.</hi> It were horrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to prefer this ſong above all the ſongs in Scripture, if it were not given by divine inſpiration as well as they.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The title of this Book is, as a crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſet upon the head of it, and is as ancient, and of as great authority as the book it ſelf: Now if this ſong were not canonicall, we ſhould make all the ſongs in Scripture in compariſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we conſider that ſpeech in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>Thy noſe is like to the tower of Lebanon.</hi> Now the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Lebanon</hi> was not built untill a long time after <hi>Solomon</hi> had married with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, how odious and unſeemly would the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have been, if it had been made in reſpect of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The deſcription of the Bride and the Bridegroom are ſo tranſcendent and excellent, that they cannot be applyed to any, but to Chriſt and his Church: And although none of the ten proper names in Hebrew be once named in this ſong; yet this Book is full of ſuch names, as doe moſt of all ſuit with the argument thereof, as <hi>King, Welbeloved, Brother, Shepheard, the chiefe of ten thouſand,</hi> &amp;c. That moſt excellent ſhining glory, dignity, and Majeſty, which is here put upon the Bridegroom, can belong to none beſide Chriſt. And as for the Bride, ſhee is deſcribed by ſuch rare beauty and glory, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter: for how is ſhee compared with all that dwell under <hi>Solomons</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? and how is ſhe found black, parched with the ſunne, and afflicted by her Brethren?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is manifeſt that Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of this Book by applying the phraſes, and borrowing of matter and frame of ſpeech from it, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Draw me,</hi> &amp;c. Suitable to that are the words of Chriſt, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>None can come to me,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118024:11"/>
unleſſe the father draw him.</hi> Again in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Behold him through the caſement, looking through the grates,</hi> &amp;c. Agreeable is this, to that of the Apoſtle, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>We behold the glory of the Lord as through a glaſſe, or caſement.</hi> See alſo the title which Chriſt giveth his Church, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. calling her <hi>undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> agreeable to the Apoſtle, who would <hi>preſent the Church to Chriſt, as a chaſt and pure Virgin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe places, with many other, which might be brought, do clearly demonſtrate what a ſympathy and agreement there is between this ſong and the new Teſtament, and with the matter and manner of phraſe alledged there, by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There would be open contradictions found to be in this ſong, if it were applyed to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Chriſt and his Church; for how can it be ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter, that ſhee is <hi>the only child of her mother,</hi> Chap. 5. 6. when in the laſt Chapter, that ſhe had <hi>a little ſiſter?</hi> Now concerning the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhee is called <hi>the mother of us all,</hi> and the Church is but one in Chriſt: but in reſpect of thoſe ſeverall congregations that the Church is divided into, ſhe may be ſaid to have many ſiſters; and thus according to the right interpretation, we ſee a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious agreement in this ſeeming contradiction. I might bring many more arguments to prove this ſong to be an excellent part of canonicall Scripture, but I forbear, foraſmuch as the ſeverall paſſages of it will agree to the experience of the beſt Chriſtians: wherefore it will be worth our time and paines to read, ſtudy, and meditate in this moſt excellent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy writ; and when we come to underſtand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118024:11"/>
this ſong clearly, wee ſhall be forced to confeſſe, that there is not ſuch choiſe and heavenly matter, neither the like ſweetneſs and comfort in any ſong, as in this <hi>ſong of ſongs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we have the Author of this Song <hi>(which is Solomons)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> was the greateſt ſon of wiſedome among men, whoſe underſtanding was as large as the Sea, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29, 30. And whoſe affections were as large as his underſtanding: hee is made the holy Ghoſt's inſtrument for the compoſing of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſong of ſongs. A man of the deepeſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is made uſe of in the higheſt matters, to wit, the intercourſe of love betwixt the Lord Chriſt and his Spouſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> was a type of Chriſt:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that he had his name of peace, which is called in Hebrew <hi>Shelomoh,</hi> but after the Greek <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, peaceable,</hi> for he was a man of peace and reſt; and God ſaid of him, <hi>Solomon ſhall be his name, and I will give him (Salom) peace and quietneſſe unto Iſrael in his dayes,</hi> 1 Chron. 22. 9. Which promiſe was made good, as wee read in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Hee had peace on all ſides round about him.</hi> Now Chriſt is our <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9, 6. and is called by the Apoſtle <hi>our peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 14. That is, he is the author and cauſe of all our peace; he is the cement, the only tie, and ground of all that peace and union between God and us, and alſo between the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> bringing them into fellowſhip and communion one with another.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſurpaſſed all the Kings of the earth in riches and wiſdome. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>And all the earth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118024:12"/>
ſought the face of Solomon, to heare his wiſdome which God had put in his heart,</hi> 1 King. 10. 24. He was the wiſeſt of all Kings, as we ſee in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>There was none like him, before him, neither after him ſhall any ariſe like unto him.</hi> He was alſo the wiſeſt Prophet, whoſe heart was lifted up higher then the ſun, and who had received a large meaſure of the ſpirit of Propheſie from the Lord: but yet behold Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>a greater then Solomon,</hi> Matth. 12. 42. For in him are the <hi>treaſures of wiſdome,</hi> Col. 2. 3. That is, Chriſt had in him the perfection of all wiſdome and knowledg: and the Apoſtle calleth him in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>The wiſdome of God.</hi> Chriſt is eſſentiall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and underſtanding: <hi>Counſell is mine, and ſound wiſdome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am underſtanding,</hi> Prov. 8. 14. This ſong therefore is commended unto us by the holy Ghoſt, in the higheſt degree of excellency, in reſpect of the Author, who was ſuch an eminent type of Chriſt both in peace and wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve from hence, <hi>that Solomon is a canonized Saint,</hi> elſe he had not been the Pen-man of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, and ſo to have been a Scribe of the holy Ghoſt: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks thus of all the holy Prophets and Pen-men of holy writ, in his 2 Epiſt. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Firſt know this, that no propheſie in the Scripture is of any private interpretation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> For propheſie came not in old time by the will of man that holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now <hi>Solomon</hi> being one of thoſe <hi>holy men of God,</hi> he muſt need be a deare and beloved Saint of God.</p>
                     <p>2. Hee was a moſt excellent type and figure of the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> in love, peace, wiſdome, and glory:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118024:12"/>
and Chriſt himſelfe is called <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 11. It would be therefore more then abſurd raſhneſſe to conclude him a reprobate.</p>
                     <p>3. The promiſe which God makes to <hi>David,</hi> that if <hi>Solomon</hi> ſinned, hee ſhould be chaſtiſed, but that God would never take away his mercy cleane from him, as he did from <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 14, 15. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of ſucceſſion in the Kingdome; for it would have been no comfort to have enjoyed the Kingdom for a while, and afterwards to periſh for ever; therefore it muſt be taken for a promiſe of an eſtate of life.</p>
                     <p>4. God ſpeaks well of <hi>Solomon</hi> after his death, making an honorable mention of his name, &amp; joyns him with his Father <hi>David;</hi> the Lord commending <hi>Rehoboam</hi> &amp; his people for their firſt 3. years go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Three years long they walked</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>in the way of David and Solomon.</hi> Now God never made any ſuch honourable menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a reprobate after his death, in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>5. Conſider that name of love and favour which God gave unto him, <hi>Jedidiah, beloved of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf is ſaid to have loved the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 3. which thing being true (elſe it would not have been recorded in Scripture) he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall finally from God.</p>
                     <p>7. It is ſaid in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 28. that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Prophets (of which number <hi>Solomon</hi> is one) are in the Kingdom of God: Yet the falſe Prophets are excepted, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> by whom God ſpake ſometimes in a compulſitory way; but the Lord uſed no ſuch inſtruments to be Pen-men of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118024:13"/>
8. And laſtly, his owne 3. Bookes evince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reconciliation with God: For this glorious light of Iſrael for a ſeaſon was clouded and overſhadowed by Idolatry; for it is ſaid, <hi>Solomon worſhipped ſtrange gods.</hi> Now upon theſe words the Romaniſts conclude, that <hi>Solomon</hi> died a reprobate; but Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> is of another opinion concerning theſe words: <hi>I have oftentimes muſed</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>what ſhould be the meaning of theſe words,</hi> And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> worſhipped ſtrange gods. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I could</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Brought.</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall view of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>p.</hi> 154.</note> 
                        <hi>never thinke that he could eſteem the idolls of the heathen for gods, conſidering he had ſuch wonderfull knowledge, but ſurely this is the meaning; that by allowing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines to worſhip them, and in that it was done by his Commandement, it was as his act; and this I hold, till I be better inſtructed. If he had come to ſo open a folly, as to worſhip them as God, this his ſinne muſt needs have been of very high nature, if not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is unpardonable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But however it muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>Solomon</hi> fell grievouſly by giving the reins to his luſts; yet, as it was ſaid already, his 3. laſt Books will declare what the frame and temper of his ſpirit was in his old age.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The book of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> wherein by allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries taken from the moſt excellent of the creatures, and alſo from thoſe of the loweſt ranke and eſteem, he ſheweth the wiſdome of God in the government of the world: from whence hee perſwades men to ſeek after the wiſdom of God, admoniſhes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to beware of ſtrange women, and labours to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them in the grounds of Religion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Booke called the <hi>Preacher,</hi> which book
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118024:13"/>
was made in his old age, and after his recovery out of ſin: he beginneth, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ſaith the Preacher. He preached worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from ſelfe-experience, admoniſhing others to beware by his evill. In which Book he ſheweth in generall the tranſitory eſtate of all things in the world. For, ſaith he, conſider the Sun, <hi>it riſeth and ſetteth, and returneth again to his place. The winde goeth toward the South, and turneth about into the North: it whirleth about continually, and it returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain according to his circuits. All the rivers run into the Sea, yet the ſea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</hi> So by this he ſheweth, that there is no felicity in any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun, but all is vanity. He goes on, and tries wiſdome and knowledg; but ſaith he, <hi>in much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is much griefe, and he that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth ſorrow.</hi> He went yet further, and tryed all pleaſant things; for (ſaith he) <hi>I made great works, I built houſes, ſet Gardens and Orchards, and I plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted trees in them of all kind of fruits. I made mee pooles of water,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, I was full, and much encreaſed, I wanted nothing that my heart could deſire: but when I began to conſider what felicity theſe things could bring unto mee, I beheld no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and that there was no profit under the Sun.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This moſt divine ſong penned (as was hinted before) in his old age: his affections and his mind is taken up in contemplating and celebrating thoſe ſweet myſteries of Chriſt and his Church, and of that intercourſe of love paſſing between them: his heart is now lifted up higher then all the things
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118024:14"/>
under the Sun, reckoning of them nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of ſpirit. Now by what hath been ſaid, wee may conclude <hi>Solomon</hi> a glorious Saint of God, and therefore ſhould be ſtirred up to the ſtudy and meditation of this Book the more, for <hi>Solomons</hi> ſake, the Pen-man thereof.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>The laſt of theſe ſerves for our purpoſe; for in theſe words, <hi>Let him kiſſe me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Church deſires that the ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pledges of Chriſts love may be given in unto her.</p>
                     <p>By a mentonymie, ſhee putteth the ſigne for the thing ſignified; for a kiſs is but a pledg of that love of Chriſt, which ſhee deſires to be made a partaker of. Here we have an exclamation, full of ſpirituall paſſions and divine love; with which the Church is enflamed, and as it were impatient in her deſires, after a nearer conjunction with Chriſt. Let us ſee it farther, what that is which the Church ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire, in the following words.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">

                     <p>The Church doth not ſay, with the kiſſes of his lips, for that is a more ſilent and ſtill geſture; but <hi>the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> which is no ſuperfluous ſpeech here; but it implyeth the heavenly &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches which proceed out of Chriſts mouth. <hi>Grace was in Chriſts lips,</hi> Pſal. 45. 3. All Chriſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were ſweet, and his heart was a treaſure of divine grace: his mouth then by which hee utters the things that are in his heart, muſt needs be ſweet and deſireable.</p>
                     <p>Qu. <hi>But was ever the Spouſe of Chriſt without all pledges of his love? or, was ſhee ever without the word? for ſhee ſeemeth to cry after that which ſhee had not?</hi>

                     <p>The promiſe was firſt made to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſeed of the woman. After this, the promiſe was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with <hi>Abraham:</hi> And after that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were come out of Aegypt, his Lawes and Ordinances were more fully delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but as yet all things were under figures and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; the Church was as a child in her non-age, and in that reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, they were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tutors and governors, untill the time appointed of the Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 1, 2. And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 23, 24. he ſaith, they were <hi>kept under the law, ſhut up unto the faith, which ſhould afterwards be revealed;</hi> which law was a <hi>School-maſter unto Chriſt.</hi> In this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith; that the heirs of life and ſalvation were but <hi>Children</hi> before Chriſts Incarnation, becauſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall they knew but as children, for that we have done ſince: beſides other points of minority touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legality and ceremonies, which the Apoſtle in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place calls elements or rudiments; ſo that their light was but an obſcure &amp; glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring light to ours now in the dayes of the Goſpel. Chriſts diſcovery of himſelf then was but <hi>a ſtanding behind the wall, a looking forth of the window, a ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe through the lattice,</hi> Cant. 2. 9. So although the godly in the time of the Prophets <hi>ſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes afar off, and embraced them:</hi> yet they had them but in the expectation, not in the enjoyment: they had the promiſes in reſpect of the benefit, but not in the perfection of them. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 39, 40.</note> 
                        <hi>receiued not the promiſe: God having provided ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118024:16"/>
things for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> Now the Prophets fore-ſaw and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of the riſing of the ſun of Righteouſneſſe, that bright morning ſtar, who would make glorious diſcoveries of heavenly light: and they alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed of the powring forth of the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of revelation after Chriſt's comming in the fleſh: and hence it is, that many <hi>Kings, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and righteous men deſired to ſee Chriſts day, and ſaw it not,</hi> Luk. 10. 24.</p>
                     <p>This is one of the kiſſes of Chriſts mouth, which the Church did ſo vehemently deſire, ſaying, <hi>Let him kiſſe me,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby the Church deſireth to have Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh, and to have the ſweet and comfortable Doctrines of the Goſpel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to her heart, and that ſhee might not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under a legall diſpenſation, for the law <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. It was <hi>a miniſtration of death,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. for the tenour of it runs thus, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the law,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>after that faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter,</hi> Gal. 3. 25. That is, now we are not as children in knowledg and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that wee ſhould need a School-maſter; but we are as men of riper years, and as men grown in knowledg, by the cleare light and ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel: ſo the Church deſireth here, that ſhee might be prevented with the grace of Chriſt, and have the feeling of his love and favour towards her.</p>

This was grounded upon ſome taſts of Chriſts love; for Chriſt had not ſpoken as yet to the Spouſe; but ſhee on a ſudden (as it were) without any word from Chriſt, utters this vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exclamation of hers, and that without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, then that <hi>his love is better then wine.</hi> See this in the Apoſtle: he counted all things but <hi>dung,</hi>

The Church here deſires Chriſts manifeſtation in the fleſh, that ſhee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118024:17"/>
might enjoy him in a Goſpel-diſpenſation, and have ſweeter diſcoveries of his favour: ſo in like manner the Church of the New Teſtament, who did enjoy all the priviledges of the Goſpel; yet ſhe goes higher in her affections, and deſires Chriſts laſt comming, that ſo ſhe might enjoy him in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly &amp; everlaſting communion, which the Saints ſhall enjoy hereafter.</p>
                     <p>2. Obſerve; that <hi>Chriſt hath given more ſweet and comfortable pledges of love and reconciliation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Goſpel, then he did under the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that Chriſt telleth his Diſciples, and ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee that yee ſee. For I tell you, many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which yee ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to hear thoſe things which yee heare, and have not heard them,</hi> Luk. 10. 24. To this purpoſe is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20. For <hi>you are not come unto the mount not to be touched, and that burned with fire: Nor unto blackneſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt, and the ſound of a Trumpet, &amp; the voyce of words,</hi> &amp;c. By the mount is mount-<hi>Sinai,</hi> whereon the law was given: and by all thoſe expreſſions of darknes and tempeſt, and fire; wee are given to underſtand the ſlaviſh, ſervile, and fearfull condition of them who were under the law: and how farre ſhort their condition came of the excellency of our condition, who are under the Goſpel. And hee ſaith further, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>But yee are come un o mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of Angls: to the generall Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt-born which are written in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. By mount-Sion he meaneth the Church under the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118024:18"/>
Goſpel, whereof mount-Sion was a type, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 7. And the Doctrine of the Goſpel was to goe out of Sion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. And by all the other expreſſions he ſheweth the happy condition of them, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. It is the ſame argument for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the Apoſtle uſes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>For ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you, for yee are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> That is, now having ſuch manifeſtations of grace under the Goſpel: ſin ſhall not take ſuch advantages againſt you, as to keep you under, or to enthrall you, as it did thoſe under the Law.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Chriſt hath powred out a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his ſpirit on his people, now in the times of the Goſpel, then before. The Saints of old have had the ſame ſpirit for ſubſtance, but not for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the ſpirit was given out unto them by ſmall drops; but in the times of the Goſpel it was <hi>powred out in ſhowers and abundance,</hi> Tit. 3. 6. The word tranſlated abundantly ſignifies <hi>Riches,</hi> which notes not only the pretiouſneſſe, but the plenty and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundancy thereof. And it is ſaid, <hi>when hee</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>aſcended up on high, and led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, he did withall give gifts unto men,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. In theſe words the Apoſtle alludeth to an old cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who in dayes of great joy and ſolempnity, did uſe to ſend gifts and preſents one to another, as we read in <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. 12. <hi>The people did eate and drinke and ſend portions.</hi> This the people did in token of their joy after their redemption from captivity. So when Chriſt aſcended up on high, as in the day of his Majeſty and Inauguration in his Kingly ſeat and Chariot of triumph; he ſent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118024:18"/>
plentifull portions and gifts of his holy ſpirit into the hearts of his people. Now in that Chriſt powrs out more abundantly of his ſpirit in the days of the Goſpel then before; the ſpirit of evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, the ſpirit of revelation and knowledg as it is called in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. Herein Chriſt hath given more pledges of his love in the times of the Goſpel, then in the times of the law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The will and mind of God is more fully and more plainly revealed to his people under the Goſpel, then it was under the Law: God let out light by little, and little, till the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe aroſe. So we have it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>God ſpake unto the Fathers by the Prophets at ſundry times, and in divers manners; but in theſe dayes he hath ſpoken by his ſonne,</hi> Verſ. 2. That is, he hath ſpoken moreful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly.</p>
                     <p>The antitheſis or oppoſition which the Apoſtle ſets between Gods ſpeaking by the Prophets of old, and by his Son in the latter age of the world, ſhews plainly the dimneſſe and darkneſſe of thoſe former ages in compariſon of thoſe, which have been ſince the comming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>3. In that the word of the Goſpel is called the kiſſe of Chriſts mouth,</p>
                     <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the Doctrine of the Goſpel is very ſweet and deſirable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From hence it is, that <hi>David</hi> doth ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the holy Doctrine of the Lord, that it is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, pure, and infallible,</hi> and of ſuch mighty opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effects, that he ſaith, <hi>it is more to be deſired then gold, yea then much fine gold, ſweeter then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or the honey-comb,</hi> Pſal. 19. In the Originall the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118024:19"/>
words run thus, <hi>ſweeter then the dropping of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-combs:</hi> It is meant of that which commeth forth without preſſing and therefore counted the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and pureſt honey of all other.</p>
                     <p>All the Epithites given in Scripture unto the Goſpel do ſhew, that it is ſweet and comfortable; it is called <hi>the good word of God,</hi> Heb. 6. 5. <hi>A good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 6. <hi>A faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>The word of life,</hi> Phil. 2. 16. <hi>The word of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>The Goſpel of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 17. <hi>The Goſpel of ſalvation, and the word of truth,</hi> Eph. 1. 13.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Goſpel brings glorious effects along with it; as liberty to Captives, and bleſſed joy and comfort to thoſe in diſtreſſe, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. It is <hi>tidings of great joy,</hi> viz. of reconciliation to God by Chriſt, and of peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>It is no other then the ſweet kiſſes of Chriſts mouth; and thoſe heavenly Oracles of his mouth, whereby he calleth, enlightneth, comforteth, and worketh faith in his people. Chriſts affections were (as I may ſo ſpeak) dyed in love and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and his heart was as a fountain of grace, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs muſt his mouth be ſweet, which is (as it were) the inſtrument by which he utters what is in his heart. Chriſt conveyeth all his graces and all good things into his people by the word of his mouth. No marvail then, though the Church be enflamed with the deſire of the kiſſes of his mouth.</p>
                     <p>4. Obſerve from the reaſon which the Church renders of her moſt earneſt longings and deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt: <hi>For thy loves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:118024:19"/>
That <hi>thoſe ſtrong deſires, and thoſe earneſt longings of the faithfull after Chriſt, they flow from a principle of love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Love is impulſive and conſtraining, it hath a ſweet kind of violence to draw out all the affections of the ſoule unto Chriſt, ſee this in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with mercies have I drawn thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord. And in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now wee muſt underſtand this principle of love to be, either Chriſts love to us, or our love to him; for there is an interchange of ſpiritual love between Chriſt and his people. Firſt, Chriſts love to us (in reſpect of the extrinſicall part of it) is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of his love to us by the evident teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his favour &amp; grace: and by uniting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto us, making of us to partake with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his own goodneſſe. Now by the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Chriſts love to us, he begets in our ſouls a love of him: his love is, as the cauſe, our love as the effect: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the rivers, <hi>that they both come from, and return again into the Sea,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 7. So Chriſt is the ocean of ſpiritual love, from whence we derive, and in to which we return our love: ſo that our love proceeds from Chriſt's love; his love is as a load-ſtone, attractive, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our affections to him; our love is as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting backe to him again the beames of his owne love.</p>
                     <p>Now that principle of love by which wee are drawn to Chriſt, is both Chriſt's love to us, and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118024:20"/>
fruits thereof, namely our love to him. Now there are three things in love, whereby the affections of the ſoul are drawn unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An affection of the will, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto the thing beloved: Now the nature of the will is <hi>elicita,</hi> not <hi>coacta,</hi> inclined and drawn forth, not compelled and conſtrained; will ſhould be no will, if it were ſo: but there is that divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, &amp; that excellent dignity in Chriſt, which is as a load-ſtone, very attractive, &amp; an object very tempting and alluring to bend, to draw, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the will, making of it to cloſe with Chriſt, as with the beſt, and moſt excellent object in all the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A deſire of union and enjoyment of the thing beloved. Now when the ſoule eyes ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent object as Chriſt is, in reſpect of his ſpirituall beauty, and ſuper-eminent worthineſſe and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it preſently covets the enjoyment and function of him; the ſoule deſires nothing more then union, then peculiarity and intereſt, then the everlaſting poſſeſſion of him, who is that love-deſerving ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A complacency or wel-pleaſedneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we reſt our ſelves well pleaſed in the goodneſſe of the thing beloved: now nothing in the world is more pleaſing to a believing ſoule then Chriſt: ſo that let his diſpenſations be what they will, his Saints are never weary of him. <hi>Yea, they take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, in diſtreſſes for his ſake: and when they be weak in themſelves, then they are ſtrong in him, and more then Conquerours,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle. Now by theſe 3.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118024:20"/>
acts or effects in love, are the affections of Believers eminently drawn out toward Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Obſerve from her form of ſpeech <hi>(thy loves)</hi> ſpeaking in the plurall number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the love of God in Chriſt is an infinite, and a manifeſt love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle would have the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, the breadth, and length, the depth and heighth of the love of God in Chriſt:</hi> but yet for all that he concludes, that <hi>it paſseth knowledge,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 18, 19. God's love is of one nature and ſubſtance, but it is various in reſpect of the diſpenſations thereof. Love is an internall affection in God, and therefore it paſſeth underſtanding; ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive of it as it is in it ſelfe: but onely wee know and underſtand it according to the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof. Now the acts, or the effects of Gods love in Chriſt are various and many, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that wee ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love: who hath predeſtinated us to be adopted through Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will: To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, whereby hee hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Here we ſee the firſt act of Gods love in chooſing of his before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world; and that (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>according to his purpoſe,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 11.</p>

and freedome. Our redemption was a full teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his love, as appears by theſe Scriptures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Gal. 4. 4. <hi>For when the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his ſonne, made of a woman, made under the law, that wee might receive the adoption of ſonnes.</hi> So in <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own hlood.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>The man Chriſt, who gave himſelfe a price of our redemption.</hi> This was a plain demonſtration of Gods love in Chriſt; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods love of calling: now there is a double calling, an inward and an outward; the outward is a bare propounding of the Goſpel; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call is a ſpirituall enlightning, whereby the ſoule is enlightned by the ſpirit of wiſdome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, <hi>to know the hope of his calling,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 17. And that whereby the ſoule is made able to <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, of whom it is apprehended,</hi> Phil. 3. 12. This is that grace begotten in the will of man (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper ſubject of this grace) by which meanes the whole man is converted unto God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We have Gods juſtifying love, whereby hee doth free and diſcharge his people from ſinne and death, and accounts them righteous in Chriſt.</p>

This excellent dignity is procured for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118024:21"/>
us by Chriſt, as a Redeemer. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>God ſent his ſonne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to redeeme them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes, And becauſe yee are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſonne into your hearts, crying abba, Father.</hi> Obſerve here, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption is called the <hi>ſpirit of the ſonne,</hi> becauſe the holy Ghoſt ſealeth up our adoption in Chriſt, ſo that through Chriſt it is made ſure unto us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. His ſanctifying love, whereby he doth free Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the filthineſſe and pollution of ſinne, and reſtore in them again the image of God, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And laſtly, his glorifying love, whereby he lifts up his people unto that ſtate of life and glory, and gives them an immortall inheritance, where all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace, and joy ſhall abound, and where they ſhall have the communion of the chiefeſt good, <hi>viz.</hi> the love of God ſhining forth immediately upon their hearts. Now though the loue of God in Chriſt be one intire, ſingle, and internall act: yet after the manner of our conceiving, it is ſet forth by diverſe externall acts or effects. And wee muſt know, that all theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects flow from that originall love of God; theſe are but new acts, proceeding from that eternall love of God, which was in his own breaſt from eternity.</p>
                     <p>6. Obſerve, <hi>That the ſence and feeling of Chriſts love is more excellent and efficacious unto Believers, then all the moſt pleaſant and delightfull things in the world.</hi> The Church doth preferre it beyond all compariſon of worldly things, ſaying, <hi>Thy loves are better then wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what is more pleaſing and delightfull to the taſt, then fragrant wine? yet Chriſt's love is the ſame, and far ſweeter to the hearts of Believers. Wine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118024:22"/>
uſefull and comfortable to man; but Chriſt exceeds in his uſefulneſſe to the ſoule: ſo that look, of what uſe or vertue wine is to man, of the ſame uſe and vertue is Chriſt to his people. The properties or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of wine are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Wine delighteth the heart of man,</hi> Pſal. 104. 15. And in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Wine maketh merry:</hi> That is, it doth refreſh, comfort, and make glad the heart of man: ſo Chriſt gives his people comfort and refreſhment in the midſt of feares and dangers: Hee is that <hi>Shilo,</hi> which brings tranquility and peace unto his Saints; he refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes them with living waters, even with the ſweet communion of his ſpirit, and with the abundance of his graces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Wine cauſeth to forget affliction and miſery,</hi> Prov. 31. 6, 7. In like manner the love of Chriſt cauſeth us to <hi>forget thoſe things that are behind,</hi> Phil. 3. 13. And the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>that he doth now rejoyce in his ſufferings,</hi> Col. 1. 24. The ſweetneſſe and the joy that he found in Chriſts love, did ſwallow up all the bitterneſſe and ſorrow of his afflictions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Wine was uſed in the legal ſacrifices and ſervice of God,</hi> Numb. 15. 5. Thus was Chriſt's love manifeſted by a ſacrifice in himſelfe, by which we draw abundance of comfort to our ſelves. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> This conſolation is much more then was in all legall ſacrifices, which could never make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wine enflames and overcommeth; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be not drunke with wine,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 18. But (ſaith he) <hi>be filled with the ſpirit;</hi> that is, let the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118024:22"/>
comforts and graces of Chriſt's ſpirit fill and overcome your hearts.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Wine is put for all delicate, comfortable or coſtly things in the world, which the greateſt ſort of men doe uſe in their Feaſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. The Lord promiſeth to make <hi>a feaſt of fat things; a feaſt of wines on the lees.</hi> He alludeth to the practice of great Kings of the earth, and delicate perſons, which follow their pleaſures, and have their ſweet wines, &amp;c. But yet they find not ſo much delight and comfort in their Feaſts, as the Saints do in the love of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that the Church cryeth out with deſire to enjoy her beloved, rendring this reaſon, that his <hi>love is better then wine;</hi> that is, better then all the ſweet and coſtly things that the Princes of the earth do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Thus we have heard the Churches deſire of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt; and the reaſon of her requeſt, drawn from the excellency of his love: now it follows in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> ſhe rendereth a reaſon of her ſo much delighting in his love.</p>

                     <p>By the powring forth of Chriſt's name, is meant the preaching and publiſhing of the Goſpel.

                     <p>Firſt, By ointment were annointed to their Offices <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets:</hi> ſo by the annointings of the ſpirit, Chriſt was conſecrated to his three-fold office of King, Prieſt, and Prophet: this was prefigured by the annointing of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, whereby they were conſecrated unto the Prieſts office, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 30. It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me to preach the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>For God hath annointed him with the oyle of gladneſſe above
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118024:25"/>
his fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45. 8. So the Prophet tells us that there ſhould <hi>come a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord was to reſt upon him, and the Spirit of wiſdome and underſtanding; the Spirit of counſell and of might, the Spirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord,</hi> Iſa, 11. 12. It is ſaid that <hi>God gave not the Spirit by meaſure unto him,</hi> John 3. 34. That is, he did not beſtow it upon him imperfectly, and in part onely, but fully and intirely: for meaſure is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that which is infinite, but to that which is not whole, intire, and perfect. Chriſt was full of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſdome, and of all Heavenly gifts. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>That in Chriſt dwells all the fullneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, bodily,</hi> Colloſſ. 2. 9. That is, not by naked and bare communicating of vertue, as God is ſaid to dwell in his Saints; but by a ſubſtantiall union of the two natures, whereby they become one, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, one perſon, or ſubſtance. Here is then the Veſſell, which as a rich treaſury is full of all Heavenly wiſdom, knowledge, Divine revelations, and all ſweet graces, even Jeſus Chriſt the Anointed of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the ſavour and by the powring out of theſe Ointments is repreſented the powring forth of the Spirit upon all the Members of Chriſt: the graces of Chriſt which are called his ſweet Ointments, they caſt a ſweet ſavour, and are powred out into all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hearts, and doe flow from him the head, into all the Members of his Myſticall body, as it is written, <hi>Of his fullneſſe we all receive, and grace for grace.</hi> John 1. 16. That is, we receive ſuitable graces for his graces; we receive part of every communicable grace of his. This ſacred Oile was powred (as upon <hi>Aaron</hi> ſo) upon Chriſt who was the head of all Saints; and from him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118024:26"/>
that was the head, this Ointment of the Spirit runs downe his Myſticall body, even to the hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>But yee have an unction from the holy one, and yee know all things,</hi> 1 John 2. 20. That is, you have the Spirit of Truth which leadeth you into all Truth. And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>But he hath anointed us, and made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This anointing of the Saints by the Spirit of Chriſt was prefigured, in that the Tabernacle (a figure of the Church of the new Teſtament) and all the Veſſels of the Tabernacle (which figured out the particular members) were all anointed with the holy Oile, and conſecrated unto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 23. 25. Chriſt hath received the Spirit as a publique perſon, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head of all his Church, he then is the head and ſeat of all ſpirituall influence from which the myſtical body receives life and motion: this is the Apoſtles Similie in <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2. 19. He makes Chriſt there to be the head, and the Church the body, knit together by certaine joints, and ligaments as it is in nature: and by this means doth miniſter ſupply to all parts of the body; whereby it increaſeth with the increaſings of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in that the holy Oile (from which the compariſon was taken) was not to be powred upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man beſides the Prieſt onely, neither were they to make any other Oile after the compoſition of it, becauſe it's conſecrated Oile, <hi>Ex.</hi> 30. 32. It doth demonſtrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that none have the anointings of Chriſt upon them, but the Saints onely; a ſtranger intermeddleth not with this joy: For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He</hi> (meaning the Spirit) <hi>ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 14. He doth not ſay, the Spirit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118024:26"/>
ſhall declare thoſe things it received of him unto the World, but to his owne Servants: See alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26, 27. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: Even the Spirit of truth, whome the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but yee know him, for he dwelleth in you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</hi> Rom. 8. 9. By theſe Scriptures it is plaine, that Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers neither have, nor underſtand the ſpirit of Chriſt. Now by what hath been ſaid, it is evident that theſe precious Ointments (here mentioned in the Text) were but tipes and ſhaddows of Chriſt's graces. Firſt, as they were in himſelfe. Secondly, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in his Members. Thirdly, as they are denied to Unbeleivers, being too holy to be caſt unto Dogs: all which doe ſhew, of what a redolent ſavour, and of what odoriferous ſweetneſſe all the anointings of God are in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>That though the name of Chriſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, his glorious Goſpell, be very redolent and ſavory in it ſelf, yet the Saints come to the ſenſe and feeling thereof moſt of all, by the publiſhing and diſplaying of the Goſpell.</hi> The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were moſt ſenſible of Chriſts graces, when <hi>his name was an Ointment powred forth.</hi> The moſt full and perfect odours that are, and the moſt ſweet and pretious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World, are never felt ſo ſavory, as when they be powred forth. As the <hi>Box of pretious Ointment, when it was broken and powred on Chriſts head, the ſavour thereof filled the houſe,</hi> Mark. 14. 3. For by the Preaching of the Goſpell, or the powring forth of Chriſt's name; his fame, glory, and renowne is made knowne in the World: according to that in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 14. <hi>There went out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118024:27"/>
a fame of him throughout all the Region round about, and he taught in their Synagogues, being glorified of all.</hi> This was that the Apoſtle rejoyced in, and ſaid, <hi>Now thanks be unto God, which alwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge by us, in every place. for we are unto God a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh: to the one, a Savour of death unto death; and to the other a Savour of life unto life,</hi> 2 Cor. 14, 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Now the name of Chriſt is powred forth, when all his vertues and graces are diſplayed and laid open, when it is declared, that he hath fullfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that he hath offered up himſelfe by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit, without ſpot, unto God: and that he hath appeaſed the wrath of his Father, and made perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſins of his people; thus is Chriſts name as a pretious Ointment powred forth.</p>
                     <p>Againe, when Chriſt is ſet forth in his beauty to be Fairer then the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> to be the chiefe of ten thouſand: in his love free, rich, and everlaſting: in his graces to be compleat and full: in his Offices to be a moſt excellent Prophet, Prieſt, and King: in his riches to be the Heire of God, and of Heaven: in all the operations of his Spirit, working Sanctification and all needfull graces in his Saints; in all thoſe rich and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts which he doth beſtow on his people, redeeming of them with his pretious Blood, ſanctifying of them with his pretious graces, enriching of them with his pretious promiſes, reviving of them with his pretious love, comforting of them with his pretious Spirit, and enabling of them with pretious Priviledges: when all theſe things (as I ſaid) are opened and diſplayed, then is Chriſts name as it were, as a Box of the good Ointment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118024:27"/>
broken, and powred forth, then there is ſmelt that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſavour, that cauſeth the Virgins to love him.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of the Goſpell may learn here, and ſee, what their duty is, and which way they ſhould imploy their whole ſtrength: namely, to diſplay thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace, and to publiſh and ſpread before men thoſe manifold tranſcendent excellencies, and all thoſe wayes of ſhining glory which are in Chriſt, to draw and allure poor ſouls to come unto him. Who will ſeek after that which he knows not of? But who will not ſeeke after a pretious Jewell? O then! Let Chriſt be laid open in his natures, in his graces, in all his ſhining excellencies, dignities, and vertues; that ſo his fame being ſpread, and his name powred out as ſweet Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: by this means multitudes may be drawne unto him.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the powring forth of Chriſt's name, by the Publiſhing of the Goſpell, will be as effectuall unto thoſe that receive it, as Ointment is to the body unto which it is applied: So that looke, of what effects or uſe the moſt pretious confections are to the body of man; of the ſame effect, and of far greater uſe is the powring forth of Chriſt's name to the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Ointments are compounded of very rich and coſtly things: In this reſpect the Ointment that <hi>Mary</hi> anointed Chriſt withall, was called <hi>Pretious,</hi> becauſe (ſaith <hi>Judas) Much might have been given for it,</hi> Mark. 14. And of the pretious things which King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed to the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> this was one; namely, the <hi>Good Ointment,</hi> 2 Kings 20. 13. So is the Goſpell a compound of rich and coſtly things; it is a treaſury full of Heavenly wiſdome and Divine Revelation; it is called, <hi>Riches of glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27. <hi>And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118024:28"/>
the wiſdome and power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. The Goſpell is rich in its priviledges, in its matter, in its effects, in all the promiſes therein contained. In a word, the divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Goſpel is a diſplaying and ſpreading before men all the riches of God, and of Chriſt: the riches of wiſdome, the riches of power, the riches of love, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of mercy; all which are eminently ſhewed forth in the Goſpell. This is that the Lord told <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I will make all my goodneſſe to paſſe before thee, Exod.</hi> 33. 19. Now what doth the Lord meane by <hi>all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> but onely a Proclamation of the Goſpell unto <hi>Moſes. The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth, keeping mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Ointment is a ſigne of joy and comfort; and with ſuch they were wont to be anointed at Feaſts, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. And they uſed it in ſigne of joy, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 7, 8. Thus the Goſpel is called <hi>Tidings of great joy,</hi> Luk. 1. 19. <hi>And good Tidings,</hi> Iſa. 61. 1. The Goſpell of great joy, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10. becauſe it brings a glorious joy along with it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Ointment healeth wounded bodies, and knitteth up the joints which are broken, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34. So the Oile of Gods grace heals the bruiſes of the Souls of thoſe that are broken in Spirit: Thus we have it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Lord anointed me to Preach glad tidings to the meeke, and he hath ſent me to bind up the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Oile doth make the face to ſhine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 1. So the Goſpell putteth a ſhining and glorious luſtre on the faces of thoſe to whom it comes. It is ſaid of <hi>Stephen: That the Jewes looked ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118024:28"/>
on him, and ſaw his face, as it had been the face of an Angell,</hi> Acts 6. 15. It makes mens faces ſhine, as did the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he had beene with God on the Mount.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, By Ointment were Kings, Prieſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Anointed to their Office: So by thoſe graces brought by the Goſpell, the Saints are Anointed by Chriſt to be Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets; they are ſo made by <hi>Chriſt unto God, and his Father,</hi> Revel. 1. 6. The Goſpell giveth men the higheſt Priviledges in the World, to be Kings and Prieſts unto God: to be <hi>a royal Prieſt-hood, a holy Nation, a peculiar people;</hi> yea, a whole Nation of Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Goſpell is as Ointment powred forth, to the unſpeakable delight of the Saints, drawing and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing the minds of them that heare it, ſweetly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Jeſus Chriſt. Thus much for the cauſe, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect follows, <hi>Therefore doe the Virgins love thee.</hi> Whence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt cauſeth love in his Saints.</hi> The Originall of our love is Chriſts communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of goodnes to us; there is nothing in the ſtreams but what comes from the Fountaine: he is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of love and ſweetneſſe, who by his ſtreams flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into our hearts, cauſeth in us to abound a Divine love towards him: the fire of his love kindles the flame of our love to him againe; our Ointment is from Chriſts Ointment, the head being Anointed the Oile ran downe to the Skirts, as it was ſaid of <hi>Aaron. Love</hi> is the inclining of the will to ſomething that is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and agreeable to it ſelfe: now the nature of the will is <hi>Elicita,</hi> not <hi>Coacta,</hi> inclined and drawne forth, not compelled and conſtrained: The will is abſolute and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118024:29"/>
free, no violence can be offered to it, therefore nothing but the ſweetneſſe and efficacy of Chriſts grace, can be a Load-ſtone attractive to draw out &amp; incline the will.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the object of the will is ſomething that is good: <hi>Bonum eſt objectum voluntatis,</hi> ſayth the <hi>Moraliſt;</hi> whither it be <hi>Bonum reale,</hi> a ſubſtantiall good, or <hi>Bonum apparens,</hi> a ſeeming good, yet both are the object of the Will: Hence it is, that the tranſcendent excellency, beauty, love, goodneſſe, and thato verflowing Fountain of grace and ſweetneſſe, apprehended by the Saints, to be in Chriſt, theſe make him to be the beſt object, theſe alſo incline the Will, attract the heart, and draw the ſouls of Beleivers unto him.</p>
                     <p>Againe obſerve, that the object of the will muſt be a thing ſuitable, <hi>Bonum ſibi conveniens,</hi> a good agreable to it ſelfe. Now ſuch a proportionable good as this, is found to be in Chriſt, which is reſpondent or anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all our deſires or Capacities; he is ſuitable in all his Offices and communications, in his blood for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in his grace to adorne us, in his love for loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in his fullneſſe for empty and poore ſouls. Now when the Saints can take a ſpirituall view of Chriſt, and obſerve all the dimenſions of his love and ſweetneſſe, they apprehend him to be <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt good, farr beyond all worldly things, though of never ſo exquiſite and delicate an extraction; and therefore deſire moſt of all to have the poſſeſſion of him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in that the Church changeth her Speech from the whole to the parts; for ſhee doth not ſay <hi>I,</hi> but <hi>the Virgins love thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:118024:29"/>
Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as the whole Church, ſo every Member of Chriſt hath the ſence and feeling of Chriſts love and graces, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of his name.</hi> John 1. 10. <hi>Of his fullneſſe wee have all received, and grace for grace.</hi> Every Member hath received a meaſure and proportion from Chriſts fullneſſe. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Gift of Continency, ſaith, <hi>Every man hath his proper gift of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 7. And ſo he ſpeaketh concerning ſpirituall gifts, and ſaith, <hi>There are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all: but the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall: for to one is given by the ſame Spirit the word of wiſdome, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 4, 6, 7, 8. And ſo the whole Chapter goes on, and tells us, that the Church is the myſtical body of Chriſt; and though the body be but one, yet the Members are many: and that the ſame Spirit divideth to every Member as it pleaſeth himſelfe. As in the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is not any one member, but receives an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the head: So it is in the Myſticall body of Chriſt. And againe the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt doth meaſure out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable gifts and graces for every Saint; therefore as the whole Church is the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſo is every particular Member; and all the priviledges and graces belonging to the whole Church, belong to every Beleiver.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Such as are true lovers of Chriſt, are onely thoſe that are holy and pure.</hi> By Virgins here are not underſtood thoſe that are ſingle or un-married; but it ſignifieth the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118024:30"/>
and ſpirituall purity of thoſe that truely love Chriſt. Theſe are chaſt in their lives, holy in their thoughts, ſanctified in their actions. Theſe are not defiled with the World, as to give themſelves up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane luſts of the fleſh, nor to commit ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome againſt God: the Saints ſtuddy to poſſeſſe their Veſſells in Sanctification and honour: their bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, they labour to be like unto their head and Spouſe; holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure: <hi>Theſe are they which are not defiled with women, for they are Virgins,</hi> Revel. 14. 4. That is, that are not polluted with ſpirituall Fornication, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Theſe follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth.</hi> They will not follow Antichriſt for their head and guide, but they follow Chriſt, though it be with the hazzard and loſſe of all their worldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; their love ro Chriſt is pure and chaſt, like unto Virgins whoſe affections will not eaſily be drawn unto any beſides their Beloved.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it ſignifies celerity and great ſpeed, to paſſe through a Race, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 24.

                     <p>4.

Now this Ram with his two horns was <hi>puſhing Weſt-ward, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and North-ward, ſo that no beast might ſtand before him.</hi> But afterwards he ſeeth a <hi>hee-goat, that came from the Weſt,</hi> &amp;c. (which is thought to be <hi>Alexander</hi> the great) and this <hi>hee-goate came to the Ramme that had two horns, and ranne unto him in the fury of his power,</hi> Dan. 8. 6. That is, by his mighty power and ſtrength he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him.</p>
                     <p>5. It ſignifieth our whole Chriſtian: converſation, which is called a <hi>race,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 24.

a courſe or race, which is run; as it is ſaid, <hi>John fulfilled his courſe,</hi> Act. 13. 25. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7.</p>
                     <p>6. To <hi>runne,</hi> ſignifies a deſire to obtain the prize, as well as ſwiftneſſe and ſtrength: Hence the Apoſtle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that his preaching might not be in vain; for then ſaith he, <hi>I ſhould runne in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 2. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſaith, <hi>So runne that you may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 24. That is, that yee might obtain the prize, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. So here the Church hath Chriſt in her eye, as a rich and glorious prize, unto whom ſhe runs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Wee will runne after thee: And theſe follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth,</hi> Revel. 14. 4. They doe reckon Chriſt a good prize whitherſoever they run after him: they will run through thick and thin (as we uſe to ſay) <hi>through good report and evill report,</hi> that ſo they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve firſt, From the Churches prayer, <hi>Draw me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The efficient cauſe of our comming unto Chriſt, is not in our ſelves, but from Christ alone, who by the efficacy of his word, and by the ſweet operation of his ſpirit and grace, draweth us unto himſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By nature we are utterly unable to do any thing in this reſpect; for we are wholly deſtitute of the ſaving knowledg of God, and of Chriſt, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 14. 3. <hi>There is not a man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth,</hi> &amp;c. And of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man perceives not the things of the ſpirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> That is, they are to be taken and underſtood in a ſpirituall and heavenly ſenſe, to which the carnall man's reaſon cannot reach, unleſſe hee be enlightned by the holy ſpirit. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> That is, no man can ſay Jeſus is the Lord, who hath bought and redeemed him, but by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In converſion we are meerly paſſive in reſpect of the grace, which commeth from without a man, and preventeth him, becauſe there is no power in man to prepare himſelfe to grace, or to receive grace being offered unto him, or to will any thing that is good; for we are dead in ſin: Now the dead man is only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in reſpect of his quickning. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Even when we were dead in ſinnes, hath hee quickned us together with Chriſt:</hi> That is, he is dead in ſin, who hath not the life of grace in him: ſo that by the quickning power and operation of the ſpirit, is begotten in the will of man a ſpirituall principle of grace; for the will is the moſt proper and prime ſubject of this grace, becauſe the converſion of the will is an effectuall principle of the converſion of the whole man: but notwithſtanding the underſtanding doth alſo concur, not to the converſion, but in the converſion; becauſe mans converſion is not wrought without his conſent: ſo that the holy Ghoſt worketh, and of unwilling he makes us willing, not as free Agent, but only in reſpect of obedience and ſubjection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe God who hath ſaid, that light ſhould ſhine out of darkeneſſe, he it is who ſhined in our hearts.</hi> And again the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>It is</hi>

                        <hi>God who worketh in us both to will and to doe of his own good pleaſure.</hi> Where the <hi>will,</hi> is not underſtood of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the will, but of a new quality. Agreeable hereunto is that of a Father: <hi>It is certaine that wee will, when we will, but hee cauſeth us to will, who worketh in us to will.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118024:33"/>
But we muſt note alſo, that the will is active in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and it followeth the holy ſpirit, who draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; for the holy Ghoſt doth ſo bend and incline our wills, that he cauſeth us to will good perfectly: ſo there is <hi>Act us elicitus,</hi> an act of the will drawn forth, whereby it doth cloſe with Chriſt, which indeed is an act of faith. But this act of the will doth not onely depend upon a principle or habit of grace ingenerated, but alſo upon the ſecret operation of the holy ſpirit, according to that in <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me unleſſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him.</hi> And though this act of the will be drawn out freely, yet unavoydably and efficaciouſly. <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Whatſoever my Father giveth mee, ſhall come unto mee.</hi> Now in all the actings of the will in converſion, it is but as an inſtrument of the holy Ghoſt; it is firſt acted by the ſpirit, and then it acts according to the actings of the ſpirit upon it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Saints are inſufficient of themſelves, after converſion to follow Chriſt. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>yee can doe nothing,</hi> John 15. 5. That is, you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's good or acceptable. Thus the Apoſtle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of his ſpirituall life: <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. And again the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am, and the grace in mee was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I.</hi> It is not I that have taken ſuch pains, though he did it in much travail and wearineſſe, <hi>YET NOT I.</hi> Neither was it the grace of Chriſt that was in me, <hi>but the grace of Christ which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. That is, I was thus inabled for the work of the Goſpel; not by any power that was in me, but it was by the flowings in, and the actings of the Spirit of grace upon my ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue, 2. From the effect of the Churches pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118024:34"/>
                        <hi>We will run after thee. That the Saints when drawn by Chriſt, have a will to follow Chriſt.</hi> This the Apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth of himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I know not.</hi> This will appeare, if we obſerve the nature of the will; it is <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita,</hi> not <hi>coacta,</hi> inclined and drawn forth, not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and conſtrained: will ſhould be no wil if it were ſo; for the will is abſolute and free, no coactive force can be uſed againſt it, unleſſe it be ſuch as is pleaſing and delightfull to it. The old ſaving is, <hi>ducimus volentem,</hi> and <hi>trahimus nolentem:</hi> we lead him that is willing, and draw him that is unwilling: but when Chriſt is ſaid to draw us, he uſeth no compulſion ot coaction, but it's done by the ſweetneſſe and efficacy of grace, and by the ſecret operation and working of the ſpirit, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the judgement, perſwading the affections, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart, and ſwaying the will. There is in the bringing of the ſoule to Chriſt, <hi>Trahere,</hi> and <hi>Venire:</hi> the Father is ſaid to draw us, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. And here Chriſt is ſaid to draw us: now this notes to us the efficacy of grace, and that Almighty power, by which wee are drawn unto Chriſt. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Now Gods word by which he commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, is a very operative word: <hi>Let there be light</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. Such an Almighty, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and powerfull word goes out from Chriſt to draw a ſoule to himſelfe. And thus his grace works ſo ſweetly upon our hearts, whereby wee come freely and cheerfully, and therefore we are ſaid to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The regenerate will doth will all good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good; for good is it's proper object, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can properly chooſe nothing but good: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>If then I doe that which I would not, I conſent unto the law, that it is good,</hi> Rom. 7. 16.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The will ſuſpends it's actings in dubious things: when it knows not whither a thing be good or evill, it ſuſpendeth; and when it knows not whether ſuch a thing be truth or errour, it will ſuſpend it's either chooſing or refuſing of it: it will not venture in the dark, like unto the unregenerate will, but ſuſpendeth it's actings becauſe <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi>

                     <p>2. The holy will cannot properly refuſe anything that is good, becauſe it is it's proper object; but the will that's good, may be ſo much depreſſed and kept under by temptation, or by deſertion, and ſuch like diſtempers, that it cannot draw it ſelfe up to the height of it's actings; ſo that there is not that agility, ſtrength, and vigour, as there is, when it acts more ſtrongly; but however it wil's good truly, and it goes forward ſtill, though not with that vigour and eagerneſſe, as (if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) it would.</p>
                     <p>Put though the will of the regenerate be ſet free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good, yet wee muſt ſo underſtand it, that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate will cannot doe good of himſelfe: Hence it is, the Church deſireth, that Chriſt would draw her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, without whoſe help ſhee is not able to runne after him. Where grace over-ſwayes the heart, there is a readineſs to obey, and conſtantly to follow Chriſt, but ſo as it always proceedeth from Gods ſpirit, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drawing forth of the will: even as a Mother by leading her child, cauſeth it to goe, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could not: ſo the Lord draws forth, leads and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects our affections according to the actings, and good pleaſure of his owne ſpirit: our wills are but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the holy Ghoſt, and can doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the breathings in of his ſpirit upon them. This the Apoſtle teſtifies of himſelfe, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he ſaith, <hi>He that hath begun his good worke in you, he will alſo finiſh it, untill the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 6.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118024:35"/>
We cannot work that which is good with grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſſe there be the continuall flowings in of Chriſt's Spirit, to carry forth the ſoul in it's workings. So that free grace is in the beginning, middeſt, and end of all our workings. Herein we are made happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any merit, that wee ſhould be unto the praiſe and glory of the riches of his free grace.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118024:38"/>
not eſcape, no not in their Chambers of ſafety. So that here by Chambers is hinted out to us, Chriſts protecting and preſerving of his Saints.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve hence, firſt, from the title given to Chriſt, <hi>The King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt is King and head over his Church.</hi> Chriſt was the naturall Son of God, <hi>and thought it not robbery to be equall with God,</hi> Phil. 2. 6. <hi>For by him the World was made, who was the brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his perſon, and upholdeth all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 2, 3. Therefore this prerogative will very well befit the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>God hath deſigned and appointed Chriſt to this great Office and dignity, <hi>He loveth him and hath given all things into his hand,</hi> John 3. 35. <hi>He judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgement to his Son,</hi> John 5. 22. <hi>He hath made him to be Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Acts 2. 36. <hi>He hath appointed him over his owne houſe,</hi> Heb. 3. 2. 6. And ſaith God, <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion, or the Hill of my Holineſſe,</hi> and that by vertue of a ſolemn decree; <hi>I will declare the decree,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 2. 6, 7. <hi>And the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulders,</hi> Iſa. 9. 7.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt is a King, whoſe glory and dignity ſhines forth moſt eminently, for ſaith God, <hi>I will make my firſt-borne higher then the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 89. 27. Chriſt is a King above all other Kings; and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, his Kingdome is ſpirituall, he rules over the ſouls and Conſciences of men: other Kings may ſubject the bodies and eſtates of ſuch as are under them, but not their Conſciences; this is Chriſt's glory which he will not give to another. <hi>Ye are bought with a price</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be not ye ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 23. That
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118024:38"/>
is, doe not mancipate and inſlave your Conſciences to any humane deviſe in matters meerly ſpiritual; becauſe Chriſt alone is King of the Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt is an univerſall King.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in reſpect of all Nations; <hi>There was given him Dominion, and glory, and a Kingdome, that all people and Nations, and Languages ſhould ſerve him,</hi> Dan. 7. 14. <hi>The Heathen are his Inheritance, and the ends of the Earth his poſſeſſion.</hi> Pſal. 2. 8. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Preachers of the Goſpell, ſaith, <hi>Their ſound went into all the Earth, and their words to the end of the World,</hi> Rom. 10. 18.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in reſpect of all ſorts and conditions of men; this is elegantly ſet forth by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 19. Where God promiſeth <hi>To plant in the Wilderneſſe the Cedar, the Shittath Tree, the Myrtle; the Oile-Tree, the Fir-Tree, the Pine, and the Box-Tree together.</hi> This is alſo ſweetly repreſented unto <hi>Peter</hi> by a Sheet knit at fowre corners, wherein were all manner of fowr-footed beaſts of the Earth, and wild beaſts, and creeping things, and Fowles of the Aire, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 12. By this we are taught, that not onely the Gentiles as well as the Jewes were to be received into Chriſt's Kingdome; but alſo that in every Nation (as himſelfe afterwards Expounds it) he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him, Verſ. 35.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is King univerſall, in reſpect of all ages and times of the World. <hi>God is my King of old,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 12. It is meant of Chriſt becauſe it is ſaid of him in the following words, <hi>Hee worketh Salvation in the midſt of the Earth.</hi> It is Chriſt that worketh Salvation in the midſt of the Earth; and he is called <hi>a King eternall, immortall,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:118024:39"/>
Thirdly, Chriſt rules alone; he hath no colleague or partner; he carries the Government upon his owne Shoulders, as we read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. He alone hath received power from on high in Governing of his Church.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is an everlaſting King; <hi>He receives a Kingdome that cannot be ſhaken: The God of Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ſhall ſet up a Kingdome which ſhall never be deſtroyed; neieher ſhall it be left to other people, but it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Dan. 2. 44.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, Chriſt is matchleſſe and eminent above all other Kings in all royall vertues and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he is wiſe and ſapient, and therefore called <hi>Counſellour, onely wiſe, the wonderfull numberer,</hi> which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the ſum full of wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a moſt magnificent and warlike King; hence Chriſt is called, <hi>A man of War, the Lord of Hoſts, the Captaine of our Salvation:</hi> he overcomes all his Enemies, and his foes are made his foot-ſtoole.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a moſt juſt and righteous King; he reigns in righteouſneſſe; his Scepter is a Scepter of rectitude and uprightneſſe, <hi>He is called the Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt ſweetly draws and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades his people to a neer communion with himſelfe. The King hath brought me,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt doth win the hearts of his people by love and goodneſſe. This is manifeſted Chap. 2. Verſ. 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>He brought me into the Banqueting Houſe, and his banner over me was love.</hi> A flag, or enſigne is a warlike ſigne, whereby Souldiers are drawne from place to place: So here, Chriſt ſets up a Banner of love and goodneſſe, whereby he draws his people after him; when he diſplayes his Banner, then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118024:39"/>
                        <hi>all the Armies in Heaven and Earth follow him.</hi> It was by love we were redeemed; for <hi>Chriſt loved his Church</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and gave himſelfe for it,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25. By love we are ſanctified and cleanſed, as we have it in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. Chriſt <hi>hath loved us and hath waſhed us in his blood.</hi> He hath waſhed us, both from the guilt and pollution of ſin, and all from love. It is alſo by the ſame love wherewithall Chriſt doth win and draw his people after him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve, <hi>Chriſt revealeth to his Saints, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden Myſteries of the Goſpell.</hi> Chriſt leads his people into his privy Chambers, and diſplayeth the ſecrets of God to them that feare him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, firſt, Chambers are the places in which the Bridegroome and the Bride uſe to rejoyce together, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> 2. 16. So Chriſt as the Bridegroome rejoyceth over the Bride, and doth communicate ſpirituall comforts unto her, <hi>Such as eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him: but God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, and thus we have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10, 16. This is that the Apoſtle doth earneſtly deſire, that the Church of the <hi>Colloſſians might have their hearts comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the fulneſſe of underſtanding, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt: in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> Colloſ. 2. 2, 3. When Chriſt revealeth ſuch Myſteries unto his Saints, he may be ſaid then to lead them into his Chambers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, touching theſe Chambers or inner rooms, they import a ſight of rich Treaſures, or pretious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118024:40"/>
Kings have the greateſt treaſures upon Earth; and they keep their richeſt Ornaments and pretious things in their Chambers. Now Chriſt is the richeſt of all Kings, and he like a Kingly Bridegroome leadeth his Spouſe into his Chambers, and ſheweth her all his riches and glory which he hath laid up for her in the Heavens. Chriſt is rich in love, rich in mercy, rich in grace, rich in wiſdome, and rich in knowledge: yea, as rich as God himſelfe: now Chriſt ſpreadeth theſe his riches before his Saints, that they may ſee how rich they be in him.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt know Chriſt leads his people into his Chambers by degrees; he led his Church into his Chambers in the time of the Law, and ſhewed her the riches and glory of his Kingdome: but this he hath done more fully under the Goſpell, ſince his manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fleſh, ſince the riſing of the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſhining of that morning Starre: and moſt fully it ſhall be done at the conſummation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chriſt and his Spouſe. Here the Spouſe hath ſome glimmerings of theſe riches, but then ſhee ſhall have them in perfect ſight: here ſhee injoys them by vertue of a promiſe, but then ſhee ſhall have the full fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly Obſerve, <hi>The Saints are moſt ſafe and ſecure in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chambers are places of great ſecurity, therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee, hide thy ſelfe for a very little moment, untill the indignation be over paſt,</hi> Iſa. 26. 20. And thus Chriſt comforteth his Diſciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſecution of men, <hi>Theſe things I have ſpoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace; in the World yee ſhall have Tribulation; but be of good cheer I have overcome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118024:40"/>
the World,</hi> John 16. 33. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſuſteineth his faith by the power and protection of God, <hi>For in the time of trouble</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſhall hide me in his pavilion, in the ſecret of his Tabernacle ſhall he hide me, he ſhall ſet me up upon a Rock,</hi> Pſal. 27. 5. That is, he ſhall keep me ſafe as in the moſt holy of his Sanctuary, into which none might enter but the Prieſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 2. And therefore it is called Gods <hi>hidden place,</hi> Ezek. 7. 22. And the Saints are called <hi>hidden ones,</hi> Pſal. 83. 4. becauſe they are hidden of God, in his Tabernacle in the evill day. And their life is <hi>hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Colloſ. 3. 3. Chriſt therefore is a Chamber of ſafety and preſervation to his people in evill times.</p>
                     <p>So much for the fruits or effects enſuing the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer of the Church. Now followeth her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ingagement in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That thoſe glorious diſcoveries of Chriſt made</hi> (towit, in his Chambers) <hi>to the Saints, cauſeth in them glorious and unſpeakable joy.</hi> It makes them to rejoyce inwardly, and to triumph outwardly; yea, they leap for joy: their joy is like the joy in Harveſt, and like to thoſe that divide the ſpoile, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 3. As <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> leapt in his Mothers Womb at the tidings of Chriſt: So the Saints cannot but rejoyce in the ſpirituall revelation of Chriſt; whoſe Kingdome is not meat and drink, but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. Wherefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoule ſhall be joyfull in my God; for he hath cloathed me with the Garments of Salvation, he hath covered me with the Robe of reghteouſneſſe; as a Bridegroome decketh himſelfe with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelfe with Jewells,</hi> Iſa. 61. 10. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>In rejoycing I will rejoyce;</hi> that is, with exceeding great joy: this joy is called <hi>unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. foraſmuch as the thing it ſelfe wherein we rejoyce, and the workings of Chriſts Spirit, cauſing this joy, is more Heavenly and divine, then we can either conceive or expreſſe. And this is that which the Apoſtle exhorteth us unto, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> And he ſaith further, take it upon good grounds, foraſmuch as you have the true cauſe of joy. <hi>And again
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118024:43"/>
I ſay rejoyce.</hi> Take a Virgin which is betrothed to ſome great Prince, and lead her into his Chambers, and ſhew unto her all his rich Treaſures, and Jewells which are reſerved for her: will it not make her greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? Thus the ſoul is led into the Heavenly Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and there is ſhewed unto her the glory and riches given her by Chriſt, how is it poſſible but ſhe ſhould rejoyce and be glad? and rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve, <hi>The Saints record and make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Chriſts manifeſtations of love to their ſouls. Come and heare</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) ye that feare the Lord, and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoule.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I ſhall tell you of many ſtrange paſſages of love, which the Lord hath ſhewed towards me. And this is that the Prophet calls for, ſaying, <hi>Praiſe the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the People, make mention that his name is exalted,</hi> Iſa. 12. 3, 4. And againe, <hi>I will menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the loving-kindneſſe of the Lord, the praiſes of the Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he hath beſtowed upon us, and the great goodneſſe towards the houſe of Iſrael, which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his mercye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now the Memory is the Store-houſe of the ſoule; if it were not for this faculty, all the favours we receive from Chriſt would be loſt and forgotten, it would be as the Prophet ſpeaketh of him that earneth wages, to <hi>put it in a bag with holes,</hi> Hag. 1. 6. And forgetfullneſſe is complained of very much in <hi>Jer. 2. 32. Can a Maid
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118024:44"/>
forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number;</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, I am much better unto you then your garments, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and if it be ſuch a hard thing to forget ſuch things as they, how is it that you have forgotten me.

miſery. Now in all theſe reſpects ſinne may be called darkneſſe and blackneſſe: and ſeeing this is the nature of ſin, the Church in reſpect of the remainders of ſinne may ſay, <hi>I am blacke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. By blackneſſe we may underſtand her ſorrow and mourning for her preſent miſeries; for black colour was the habit of mourners; <hi>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: aſtoniſhment hath taken hold on me,</hi> Jer. 8. 21. That is, I go in black, as mourners uſe to do; or elſe, I mourn and am in heavineſſe. Now wee may take ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe interpretations, concerning the Churches blackneſſe; for ſhe was under the ſcorching ſun of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and under the darkneſſe of ſin by her negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and under blackneſſe of ſorrow and mourning, becauſe of the two former, to wit, trouble and ſin: ſo the ſumme of all is this much, <hi>I am blacke:</hi> If you look upon me with carnall eyes, my fairneſſe doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the eye of ſenſe and reaſon: I have no externall beauty, and therefore if you look upon me, as the world looks upon me, I ſhall ſeeme to be black, and without any comelineſſe at all.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now comelineſſe conſiſteth in two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in fairneſſe of Complexion: thus Chriſt is ſaid to be beautifull by his countenance and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Cant. 5. 10. My beloved is white and ruddy.</hi> White and red ſhew the beſt temperature in man, &amp; the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe two colours makes a beautifull and good complexion. Herein the Church is alſo beautifull, and commended for the comelineſſe of her countenance, <hi>Song 2. 14. And thy countenance is comely,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. In a juſt ſymmetry or proportion of parts: and thus Chriſt is ſet forth to be comely, by that pleaſant harmony and ſpecious conſent of parts, which is found to be in him. <hi>Song</hi> 5. 10, &amp;c. where the Church doth ſumme and reckon up all his parts, from top to toe, (as we uſe to ſay) from his head to his feete; and at laſt concludes thus, <hi>he is altogether lovely.</hi> But this is not meant of the outward lineaments and proportion of his body, but of his ſpirituall beauty and grace. Now the Church muſt needs be alſo beautifull, in reſpect of inward and ſpirituall beauty; foraſmuch as ſhee is the <hi>workmanſhip of God created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 10. So that as we were Gods workmanſhip in our firſt creation, ſo likewiſe in our regeneration or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118024:48"/>
ſecond creation. This workmanſhip of God is that whereby he doth renew us by his ſpirit, and change our wills to holineſs and righteouſneſſe, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth his own glorious image: So that now all parts of man are renewed, and ſanctified; they have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a proportion of grace, and they all ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with one harmonious conſent to act for Chriſt, even as they are acted by his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now it appeareth that the Churches comelineſſe is not any naturall beauty; but it's ſupernaturall, it is a derivative beauty. Thus we have it in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 12, 13, 14. Where the Lord ſaith; <hi>I cloathed thee with broidered worke,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>And I decked thee with ornaments, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>And I put upon thee jewels of ſilver and gold,</hi> verſ. 12. And ſaith God, <hi>Thy renown went forth among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my comelineſs which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> verſ. 14. The Lord gave of his own beauty and excellency, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> became beautifull and glorious: So all the Saints ſhine in the glory and excellency of Jeſus Chriſt. Hence we are ſaid, <hi>to put on the new man,</hi> Coloſ. 3. 10. The Apoſtle uſeth a metaphor, taken from the putting on of garments, to ſhew, that thoſe graces which wee receive from Chriſt, are ſo many additions to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that we are wholly deſtitute and naked by nature, having no form nor comelineſs upon us: but thoſe renewed graces, which are after the image of God; they are as beautifull ornaments to our ſoules. Now in this reſpect the Church is comely, yea, and ſhee is much more comely then ſhee is blacke; ſhee is not ſo black in her ſelfe, as ſhee is comely in Chriſt.</p>

Now it was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to call the whole the mother, and the parts the daughters: So the Villages round about a City, are called the daughters of the Citie, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 18. And ſo <hi>Jeruſalem which is above,</hi> is called <hi>the mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. whoſe daughters are all particular Churches and Saints.

1 Chron. 17. 1. but <hi>Solomons Curtaines</hi> ſeem here to be meant of thoſe Hangings that were in his houſe, and about his bed. <hi>Solomon</hi> was glorious, in riches, in wealth, and in honour: he built great Houſes, ſet Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Planted Vineyards, and Trees of all ſorts; he was glorious in his Man-ſervants and Maids, and had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born in his Houſe, &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Now as all that <hi>Solomon</hi> had was glorious, ſo in all probability his Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines (or Hangings) were anſwerable to all the reſt of his glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Solomons</hi> Chambers were adorned with Planks of Carved Cedar, and of ſtone, and of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marble.

This ſets forth to us the ſurpaſſing glory of the Church, who ſhines in the graces of Chriſt, which exceeds all ordinary glory. So though the Church be black outwardly like the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> yet ſhee is in wardly beautifull as <hi>Solomons</hi> Curtaines. Let us collect ſome Obſervations from hence.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the Churches confeſſion, <hi>I am black,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That ſin and the effects thereof,</hi> towit, <hi>trouble and ſorrow, doth very much darken and overcloud the Saints of God.</hi> You heard that ſin was darkneſſe it ſelfe, and therefore darkneſſe muſt needs follow it: nothing doth more debaſe and deforme men then ſin, and the effects of it. Hence it is <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>Mine eyes are conſumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of griefe, it waxeth old becauſe of all mine Enemies.</hi> Pſal. 6. 7. That is, his affliction and trouble did caſt him very low, ſo that he was like ſome old deformed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118024:51"/>
man that had loſt his eyes. And Chriſt counſelleth the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to buy of him <hi>white Rayment,</hi> that ſhee might be <hi>cloathed,</hi> and that the <hi>ſhame</hi> of her nakedneſſe might not appear, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. That is, take a cloathing of white rayment (towit, of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe) that ſo thy defects and defaults be not diſcovered, and lie open to thy diſgrace. Thus it is ſaid of the people of Iſrael, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw that they were <hi>naked: For Aaron had made them naked unto their ſhame, amongſt their Enemies,</hi> Exod. 32. 25. That is, their fin was diſcovered as the deformity of a nakedman, who wanteth cloaths to cover it: or they were naked as being ſtript of the chiefe Ornament of their ſouls, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Ezek. 23. 29. I will diſcover the nakedneſſe of thy Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi> That is, I will make knowne thy ſhamefull forſaking of me, to ſerve Idolls. Nothing in the World doth ſo much deforme men, as ſin doth; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the Conſcience, it darkens the underſtanding, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſhadows the affections: yea, it defiles the whole man from top to toe (as we uſe to ſay) it makes him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unbeautifull and deformed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve, from the Churches confeſſion,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That true Chriſtians are ingenious to acknowledge their own defects.</hi> The Daughters of Jeruſalem were prevented in laying this charg upon the Church, by her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. There are two ſpecial grounds of this ingenuity in the Saints.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the glory of God: hereupon <hi>Joſhua</hi> exhorteth <hi>Achan</hi> to this duty: <hi>My Son, give glory to God,</hi> &amp;c. We honour God exceedingly by acknowledging our owne defects; we ſhew forth the honour of his mercy that will not take every advantage againſt us, the honour of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118024:51"/>
his power to pardon; the honour of his faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in that he keepeth Covenant with ſinfull Creatures: the honour of his wiſdome in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, even the very ſecrets of the heart: yea, we give God the glory of all his Attributes, for in debaſing our ſelves we lift up Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Saints doe by confeſſion eaſe their owne Conſciences: this we ſee in the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal, 32. 3, 4, 5. When I kept ſilence</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>my Bones waxed old:</hi> I was in great diſtemper of Spirit, and unquiet in my body, <hi>My moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer:</hi> that is meant of an airy ſubſtance, whereby the life is cheriſhed, which if it be ſpent it cauſeth death: now for eaſe in this condition, what courſe doth he take? <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will confeſſe my ſin, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin:</hi> hereby the Saints doe not onely glorifie God, but alſo obtaine reſt and peace in their owne ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Saints are deformed, and without beauty to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view of the World.</hi> The carnall eye ſeeth no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all in the Diſciples of Chriſt; they appeare in the ſame forme that Chriſt appeared in to the World: in reſpect of the ſufferings of Chriſt: the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus. <hi>His Viſage was ſo marred more then any man, and his forme more then the Sonnes of men,</hi> Iſa. 52. 14. That is, he had no reſpect or eſtimation in the eyes of worldly men: <hi>He ſeemed a Worme and no man,</hi> Pſal. 22. 6. Againe, the Prophet brings in worldly men ſpeaking thus of Chriſt, <hi>He hath no forme nor comelineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 2. And therefore <hi>he is deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> &amp;c. Verſ. 3. That is, he was ſcarce accounted worthy

that we have ſinned and have come ſhort of the glory of God; but Chriſt reſtoreth this glory in us againe: this is that the Apoſtle telleth us, when he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved the Church and gave himſelfe for it,</hi> even as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band giveth himſelfe unto his Wife: but to what end doth Chriſt thus give himſelfe unto his Church? <hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water, by the word: that he might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious Church (or Spouſe) not having ſpot or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 26, 27. And againe he ſaith, <hi>Col. 1. 22. Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us in the body of his fleſh through death, to preſent us holy &amp; unblameable, &amp; unreprovable in his ſight.</hi> The Saints are thus glorious in the eyes of Chriſt in two reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in reſpect of Juſtification, ſo they are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faire and <hi>compleat in him.</hi> They are abſolutely freed and diſcharged of ſin, being cloathed with Chriſts righteouſneſſe, they ſhine forth moſt gloriouſly in the beauty thereof. And in this ſence the Church is pure and undefiled in this World, and yet not free from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imperfection. But ſtill we muſt remember our beauty is not connaturall with us, but it is a derivative and a borrowed beauty: the Saints who are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhine in the glory and dignity of him that is head; and the Church who is the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſhineth in the beauty of him who is her Huſband.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Church is comely in ſanctification; ſhee is not onely faire from Chriſts fairneſſe, and from his imputative righteouſneſſe, but alſo in thoſe graces which ſhee hath received from Chriſt, even in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent graces infuſed into her ſoule by the Spirit of grace.

As black ſpots in the face make it ſhew the fairer, ſo the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church makes her beauty to be the greater.

                     <p>The afflictions of the Saints are but ſomething like afflictions, they are not afflictions themſelves, they are but the outſides of afflictions, the ſting and evill of them is taken away.

And againe the Apoſtle ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8, 9, 10. <hi>As deceivers and yet true, as unknowne, and yet well knowne, as dying, and behold we live, as chaſtened, and not killed, as ſorrowfull, yet alwayes rejoycing, as poore, yet making many rich, as having nothing, &amp; yet poſſeſſing althings.</hi> They were not ſo indeed, but reputed to be ſuch: or they were like unto thoſe that were ſo indeed, but they had but the ſhaddow of afflictions. Hence it is, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that <hi>we faint not: though the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16. We have new ſupplies of ſtrength every day: And ſaith the Apoſtle, our afflictions are but light, but our glory

                     <p>Now from the matter of the Churches requeſt unto Chriſt, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſt is a moſt compleat ſpirituall Shepheard, feeding, guiding, governing, and directing his flocke.</hi> The Scripture doth often aſcribe the title of <hi>Shepheard</hi> unto God, and unto Chriſt, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 2. <hi>Heare O Shepheard of Iſrael.</hi> And Chriſt is the <hi>Shepheard of our ſouls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. And ſaith he, <hi>I am the good Shepheard,</hi> John 10. 11. Chriſt hath all the properties of a good Shepheard, and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a good Shepheard is carefull to feed his Flock: ſo is Chriſt as carefull, and much more then any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Shepheard can be to feed his people. <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard or feeder,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and what is the effect? Why ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall not want:</hi> he will feed me plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and abundantly, ſo that I ſhall want nothing. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepheard.</hi> Chriſt doth excellently feed his flock.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Plentifully, with abundance, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118024:71"/>
variety of all good things: thus the Lord did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to feed his people in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>I will feed them in a good paſture, and upon the high Mountaines of Iſrael ſhall their fold be: there ſhall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat paſture ſhall they feed upon the Mountaines of Iſrael.</hi> There is a redundancy and an overflowing good in Chriſt, ſo that when he gives any good thing he gives abundance of it; if he give life, peace, joy, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, he doth not give a ſcanty meaſure of it: but he filleth the empty ſoule with good things: Chriſt is both able and willing to doe for us, <hi>far more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then we are able to aske or thinke,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 20.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth not onely feed his people with plenty, but alſo with the choiceſt food, he doth extract the very quintiſcence of all good things for them. He makes a feaſt of <hi>fat things, and the marrow of fatneſſe, and Wine on the Lees well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6. For ſuch preſerveth the ſtrength, and doth moſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh nature: So Chriſts comforts are the beſt comforts, his joy the beſt joy, his peace the beſt peace, his Spirit the beſt Spirit: Chriſt doth not feed his people with courſe diet, but with the beſt and the moſt daintieſt of heavenly food.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt feeds his people with the moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able food; he feeds them according to their appetites and deſires, according to their neceſſity or need: he hath ſtrong meat for ſtrong men, and milke for Babes, he anſwereth all our wants, and that with the greateſt ſufficiency; he is made unto us <hi>Wiſdome</hi> in reſpect of our folly, <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſanctification</hi> in reſpect of our guilt and pollution, <hi>Redemption</hi> in reſpect of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and bondage. Hence it is, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſhall not want:</hi> ſo long as the Lord is my feeder, I ſhall not want
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118024:71"/>
any thing that is good or ſuitable for me. As earthly appetites are ſatisfied with earthly food, ſo are the heavenly appetites of the Saints filled by Chriſt of all heavenly food: for of the like nature as the appetite is, muſt the food be; earthly food will ſatisfie a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appetite, and heavenly food will ſatisfie the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly appetite, and no other: now Chriſt feeds the heavenly appetites of his Saints with that heavenly <hi>Mannah,</hi> that bread which came downe from heaven; and gives them to drink of the waters of his heavenly Sanctuary, which flows from him, as from the Spring of living waters, feeding and refreſhing their ſpirituall deſires and longings, with heavenly food.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt feeds his people even to ſaturation (as I may ſay) he gives them a full meal of his ſpirituall dainties; according to this is the charge in <hi>Song</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Drinke abundantly, O my friends:</hi> the more they drink, the more wellcome they are; they may be drunken and never the worſe, neither any way diſtempered by it, but the more they drinke, the more earneſt are their deſires after it, as being ſatisfied and yet never ſatisfied, they are ſatisfied in the injoyment of it, but they think they never have enough of it. Hence it is that Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 4. 13. <hi>VVhoſoever drinks of the water that I ſhll give him ſhall never thirſt more.</hi> That is, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt with an inordinate thirſt after ſin, or earthly things, his luſtfull deſires are quenched with this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall water: but (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhll be in him a well of water, ſpringing up unto overla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life.</hi> That is, this ſpirituall water ſhall not onely refreſh and comfort the weary ſoule whereby it is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the preſence of Chriſt, but it ſhall as the water of the Sanctury, abound and increaſe more and more;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118024:72"/>
it ſhall increaſe with all the increaſings of God. Thus Chriſt as an everlaſting Spring of living waters, will continually iſſue out his ſtreams into the hearts of his people, whereby they ſhall be fed unto the full. Thus Chriſt as a good Shepheard feeds his flock.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt (as a good Shepheard) doth reſt and refreſh his people: hence the Church doth here deſire to know the place of his reſt, of his lying downe, that ſo he might not onely feed her, but (as it were) refreſh her after meat. Chriſt doth refreſh, and make his people to reſt by his preſence, by his Spirit, by his promiſe, and by his power and ſtrength, making them ſit ſecurely under his protection. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> bringeth in this refreſhing as a thing which the Lord added to his feeding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Thou haſt prepared my Table,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou haſt anointed my head with Oile.</hi> That is, thou doeſt not onely feed me abundantly in ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with all good things, but <hi>thou anointeſt my head with Oile,</hi> or <hi>thou makeſt fat my head with Oile,</hi> towit, by powring it forth upon me: wherein the Prophet allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Saginatus, pinguefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus fuit</hi>
                        </note> to thoſe hot countries, becauſe it was a uſe among them to wellcome and cheare their gueſts with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out precious ſweet Oils upon their heads. And this is that which the Lord promiſes to his flock, beſides the feeding of them, <hi>I will cauſe them to lye downe,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 15. That is, I will refreſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, I will give them reſt and peace, whereby their hearts ſhall be comforted.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Chriſt will not onely cauſe his people to lye downe and reſt, and to take their repaſt, but he will cauſe them to lye downe at <hi>noou-day:</hi> namely, in the greateſt heat of perſecution. Hence <hi>David</hi> concludeth, <hi>Though I walke in the valley of the ſhaddow of death.</hi> That
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118024:72"/>
is, though I walke in the midſt of temptations and troubles, where is nothing but fears and miſery, <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will feare none ill,</hi> But why? Becauſe <hi>thou with thy thy Rod and Staffe doeſt comfort me.</hi> That is, if I goe out of the way, and ſo fall into great danger, thou wilt ſweetly bring me home and ſecure me. it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with the hireling. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>when he ſeeth the Wolfe comming, he leaveth the ſheep and fleeth, and the Wolfe catcheth them, and ſcattereth them,</hi> John 10. 12. Hirelings and falſe Shepheards will not ſtand by their flocks in imminent dangers: but Chriſt will ſave and protect his flock in the midſt of fears and dangers: and by the rod of his power he will governe, rule, and protect his people in the greateſt extremities.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt doth lead, guid, and direct his flock, ſo ſaith <hi>David,</hi> he like a good Shepheard <hi>leadeth me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the ſtill waters, or the waters of reſt,</hi> Pſal. 23. 2. That is, he doth comfortably guide me to thoſe calm waters, ſuch as give reſt and refreſhing: and in Verſ. 3. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth my ſoule</hi> that was going aſtray and wandring from him. And <hi>he leadeth me in the paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> he ſweetly guideth me in holy paths, but not for any merrit in me, but <hi>for his name ſake.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 2. <hi>Thou leadeſt Joſeph like a flocke.</hi> And the Lord is ſaid to lead his people in the Wilderneſſe <hi>like a flocke, by the hand of Moſes and of Aaron,</hi> Pſal. 77. 20. That is, thou didſt lead them through the red Sea, and through the Wilderneſſe by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even as a Nurſe leadeth her Child by the hand, becauſe of it's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; <note place="margin">

And ſo the word <hi>Lead</hi> in the forenamed place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 2. ſignifieth an <hi>eaſie ſoft, gentle leading,</hi> with ſuſtaining of infirmity,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118024:73"/>
as when a Mother leads her Child. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſaid to drive his Cattle ſoftly leaſt they ſhould over-heat them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 14. Hence we may note</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that Chriſt doth tenderly beare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate his flock, and he doth reſtore and make up that which is broken or defective. So the Lord ſaith in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>I will bind up that which is broken, and ſtrengthen that which is ſick.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 10. He will not onely <hi>feed his flocke like a Shepheard,</hi> but <hi>he will gather the Lambs with his armes, and carry them in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi> He hath a tender care over them, that thoſe weak Chriſtians, who as Lambs are unable to walke by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he will carry them (as it were) in his boſome, and in his armes, that none of them might be loſt or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And in that he ſaith he will <hi>carry them in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;</hi> he alludeth to the cuſtome of the High-prieſt under the Law, who was to bear the names of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Pectorall or Breſt-plate upon his heart, which was to figure out unto us, the tender love and pity that Chriſt bears unto his people, comforting the comfortleſſe, reſtoring ſuch as are out of joynt, ſo that all is mercy, love and ſweetneſſe that comes from Chriſt. Full to this purpoſe is that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angell of his preſence ſaved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</hi> The place may be read interrogatively, thus, <hi>Was he not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted?</hi> &amp;c. That is, did he not take to heart the wrongs done to his people in <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Was not Chriſt, <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Gods preſence</hi> their Saviour and Conductour? <hi>Did he not beare them,</hi> as a tender Mother doth her young Child? <hi>Did he not carry them as the Eagle</hi> doth her brood, with ſuch care that ſhee her ſelfe may not hurt them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118024:73"/>
and at ſuch a height as others may not reach them to doe them any wrong?</p>
                     <p>Now in that the Church doth introduce Chriſt as a Shepheard, and her ſelf as Sheep, it holds forth unto us theſe Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That thoſe Sheep of Chriſt are apt to goe aſtray and wander from Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon, Peter:</hi> all theſe had their ſtraglings from Chriſt: So far as we are led by the fleſh we are as Sheep going aſtray.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Saints deſire therefore to be directed by Chriſt, and are willing to ſubmit themſelves to be ordered by him.</hi> It is from Chriſt the Saints deſire to have direction.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for that ſweet and heavenly food of their ſouls; for the Saints know there is but one true Shepheard, and therefore they ſeek after him alone, expecting no wholſome food unleſſe it come from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Saints doe not onely deſire the food of Chriſt, rejecting all the doctrines of men; but alſo to be refreſhed by him in the hotteſt Perſecutions. It was the manner of the Shepheards in thoſe hot Countries to drive their Sheep in the heat of the day unto a place of ſhaddow where they might lye downe and refreſh themſelves in the time of the parching heat. So the ſum of the Churches deſire is, that Chriſt would refreſh and comfort her in the hotteſt calamities and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even when Tyrants doe rage, and when all the World is in a flame; that then ſhee might lie down and refreſh her ſelfe under his ſhaddow and protection. Hence it is that the Saints rejoyce in tribulations and afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. And when they have trouble in the world they have peace in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. So that the Church is not ſolicitous how to ſhun or avoid trouble, but onely ſhee deſires to flie unto Chriſt, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118024:74"/>
he may refreſh her, and cauſe her to lye downe in peace, even in the midſt of extreame dangers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Saints deſire not onely to be fed and to be refreſhed by Chriſt; but alſo to reſt and feed with the flock of Chriſt. So the Church here deſires to know where Chriſt feedeth, and where he maketh his flock to reſt. Saints deſire to feed with Saints, and to lie down with Saints, and to have communion onely with Saints, they deſire that the precious may be ſeperated from the vile, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 19. and that their feeding may not be with ravenous VVolves and Tigers, but with the harmleſſe, innocent, and peaceable Lambs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Saints deſire ſuch food &amp; ſuch refreſhing as is heavenly and divine; they looke above the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and above themſelves, and depend upon Chriſt for heauenly food, and for ſpirituall reſt, knowing that nothing can ſecure them but a divine protection: all the ſhelters and poops that the creature can afford us are but like <hi>Jonah's Gowrd,</hi> or ſome ſuch poor ſhaddow, that cannot ſhelter us in a fiery ſtorme of perſecution. VVe may obtaine reſt and quietneſſe under Chriſts ſhaddow in evill times, but not under any ſhaddows of our owne.</p>

Now if we take this <hi>turning aſide,</hi> for her covering or hiding of her ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That to leave Chriſt, and to follow Strangers in matters of divine worſhip is ſhamefull Idolatry.</hi> Therefore it is that the Lord ſaith, he will make the <hi>wickedneſſe of the whoredomes of Judah to be diſcovered,</hi> Ezek. 23. 29. That is, as if the Lord had ſaid, I will unveile and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thy nakedneſſe, to wit, thy ſhamefull forſaking of God to ſerve Idolls.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we take the covering for pitching of her Tent, with ſeducers and falſe ſheep: Obſerve, <hi>That true Chriſtians have great care and circumſpection that they joyne not themſelves unto falſe Teachers.</hi> The faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to worſhip God aright, in ſpirit and in truth, <hi>John</hi> 4. and therefore dare not joine themſelves with Idolaters or falſe Chriſts; ſuch as ſeek to betray their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if we take her turning aſide into danger: Obſerve, <hi>That it is a very dangerous thing to follow falſe Teachers, or to joine with falſe Congregations.</hi> They are ſuch as come under covering; and falſe pretects, and Chriſt tells us, that they are rending wolves in ſheeps cloathing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. they have an externall habite of ſimplicity and humility, but inwardly they teare and devoure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, from the title given to thoſe falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Obſerve, <hi>That falſe Teachers are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of Chriſt's prerogative.</hi> Hence they are called his companions and fellows, becauſe they ſhare with Chriſt in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lordſhip, not by his appointment, but by uſurpation: neither are they companions indeed, for they are not called ſo in reſpect of any dignity or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that belongs unto them, but rather to give us to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118024:76"/>
take notice, what proud inſolent uſurpers they be, who thus joine themſelves with Chriſt in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Chriſt alone is <hi>Caput eccleſiae,</hi> the chiefe head and Shepheard of his Church, the onely Teacher ſent from God: he reſerves the headſhip and royalty over his people as peculiar to himſelfe; he alone carries the Government upon his owne ſhoulders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath ſoveraigne power and authority in ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church: he alone hath the ſupremacy of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and is Commander in chiefe, as I may ſay: he alone can command, forbid, permit, reward, puniſh, doe juſtice, and repreſſe all diſorder, which authority he hath as Mediator received from his Father: he is the great Monarch and King over his Church; and there is not any that hath ſuch ſoveraignty and rule beſides him.

Shee had been drawne aſide by falſe Prophets, and by falſe Brethren, who had challenged to themſelves the name of true Prophets, and true Churches, by which meanes the Saints and true Sheep of Chriſt, had been very much darkned in their knowledge and underſtanding, that they did not know which way to turne themſelves, being always in danger of joyning themſelves to falſe Churches, namely, to the Hocks of Chriſt's companiens.

Beſides this, we have the Apoſtles teſtimony, wherein he telleth us, that we <hi>ſee but through a glaſſe darkely, or in a riddle,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. That is, the greateſt ſight we have of Chriſt here, at the beſt it is but a dark, and ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmaticall ſight; and ſaith he, <hi>we know but in part:</hi> our knowledge is imperfect as well as our ſight. Thus <hi>Agur</hi> complaineth of himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Surely I am more bruitiſh then any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man; I never learned wiſdome, nor have the knowledge of the holy,</hi> Prov. 30. 2, 3. That is, I am more fooliſh then an ordinary man, I have not obtained to any great knowledge of holy and heavenly things. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle labours to take men from all ſelf-confidence in this reſpect. <hi>And if any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thinketh that he knows any thing, he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. That is, he that hath an opinion that his knowledge is perfect, knows nothing at all. But Chriſt doth not upbraid the Church with her ignorance, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118024:79"/>
is ready to imbrace and inſtruct her. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That Christ takes not advantage from the ſins, or from the ignorance of his people to utbraia them, but doth rather help them againſt their infirmities.</hi> The Church had many deformities and failings, ſhee had obſerved mens traditions, and neglected thoſe things which Chriſt had given her in truſt, ſhee was ignorant of the wayes of Chriſt and yet Chriſt deals very tenderly and ſweetly with her, <hi>Seing thou knoweſt not,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt is ſo far from caſting off his people for weakneſſe, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in helping and ſuſtaining his people under their infirmities. <hi>When I am weake then I am ſtrong,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And Chriſt himſelf hath commanded us, <hi>that we receive him that is weake in the faith,</hi> &amp; not to caſt him off from our fellowſhip and ſociety; ſurely then he will not caſt off his people for their weakneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, neither will he any way neglect them for ſome failings. Chriſt doth beare with the infirmities of his people, in relation to his Office of Prieſt-hood; ſo ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 2. 17, 18. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people: for in that he himſelfe hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that be tempted.</hi> That is, Chriſt was like to his Brethren in all things, ſin excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the end he might be a faithfull High-prieſt; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to neglect his people at any time, but in all their flips and overſights to ſhew them mercy: and hence it is, he hath taken our weakneſſes upon him, as a pledge, to teſtifie and aſſure us, that he will both pity and help us. Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He being tempted, is able to ſuccour them that are tempted:</hi> He doth not mean,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118024:79"/>
that Chriſt received any ability by his temptatations; but he would aſſure us thereby, that Chriſt is willing to ſuccour us under temptation, as one that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone temptations himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Now the truth of this appears yet more in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, wherein we have a ſweet compellation, or raviſhing forme of words.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt doth here commend the excellent and ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beauty of his Church, not withſtanding all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities and blackneſſe ſpoken of before.

                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>The faireſt among women.</head>
                     <p>The moſt comely beauty is uſually ſet forth by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ſtrength and valour is ſet forth by men; and when he ſaith, <hi>Faire among women,</hi> he meaneth more faire then other women, or, the faireſt of woman-kind: thus <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Chriſt is called, <hi>Bleſſed among women,</hi> Luke 1. 28. That is, more bleſſed then other women: ſo the Lyon is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrong among Beaſts,</hi> Prov. 30. 30. That is, the ſtrongeſt among Beaſts. Now the meaning muſt needs be thus, that the Church is far more excelling in all ſpirituall beauty, beyond all earthly and temporall beauty, however ſhee ſeemeth black in her owne eyes (as all the Saints are privy to their own deformities) and however others doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne her, eſteeming her to be void of beauty, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt ſhee ſeemeth to be moſt faire.

Now from this inſinuating ſweet compellation of Chriſt to his Church, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſts doth win the affections of his Saints, by ſweet inſinuations.</hi> He doth (as it were) inſinuate and get into our affections before we are aware. Hence it is, that he uſeth ſuch ſweet termes of relation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as <hi>Love, Dove, undefiled, Spouſe, Brethren, Children, Friends, Sonnes,</hi> and the like: all to inſinuate and get within their hearts, and that for theſe ends.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to aſſure them of his good will, love, delight, and acceptation. <hi>I call you no more Servants, but friends,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Becauſe that I receive from the Father, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto you,</hi> John 15. 15. That is, you are my Friends, and I deale with you as a friend, and by this you may take notice of my love and friendſhip towards you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I reveale unto you the mind of my Father.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to cauſe them to take notice of his grace and love: The Saints of Chriſt are often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blackneſſe and deformity, but ſeldome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing their beauty and fairneſſe: they can often ſee their meanneſſe but not their riches, their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but not their ſtrength; their ſins, but not their graces. The Church here had called her ſelfe black, but Chriſt calleth her faire: ſhee was ſomething black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in her owne eyes, but exceeding faire in Chriſt's eyes. Now that the Church might apprehend her owne beauty, as well as her deformity, and that ſhee might ſee her ſelfe faire in Chriſt, as well as black in her ſelfe; he uſeth this inſinuating ſweet forme of Speech, <hi>O thou fairest among women.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve, <hi>That the Church is exceeding faire and beautifull in Chriſt's eyes.</hi> The falſe Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a woman, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. But an Harlot, drunken
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118024:81"/>
and beaſtly: and the ſeverall parts thereof to <hi>Aholah,</hi> and <hi>Aholibah,</hi> Ezek. 23. whoſe Breaſts are preſſed, and the Teats of whoſe Virginity are bruiſed: but the Spouſe of Chriſt is beautifull, for whom he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>That he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water, through the word: that he might make it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and blameleſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25, 26, 27. And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The blood of Chriſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. And to this purpoſe ſee how the Church is compared in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 1. to a <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moone under her feet, and upon her head a Crowne of Twelve Starrs.</hi> The Church is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to a <hi>woman</hi> for her beauty, <hi>cloathed with the Sun,</hi> the brighteſt and moſt glorious Creature in the World, darting forth it's glorious beams into all parts: ſuch is the glory of her life and converſation, ſuch is the beauty of all her graces, ſuch is the brightneſſe of her heavenly doctrines, and as for Jewiſh rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and all worldly glory, which are mutable, like the <hi>Moone,</hi> ſhee doth tread them under her feet, as things far beneath her: and for her Ornament or Crowne, ſhee hath <hi>Twelve Starrs upon her head;</hi> and as for Crownes of gold, and all worldly dignity, ſhee treadeth as dung un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet: having the Stars, towit, thoſe ſeverall lights which Chriſt hath ſet up in her, as ſo many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones ſet in the circumference of a Crowne, for ſo many lights or glorious diſpenſations given her of Chriſt, to be glorious Ornaments about her head. Well then might Chriſt ſay unto her, <hi>Behold thou art faire my love, Behold thou art faire.</hi> And <hi>O thou faireſt among women.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now we muſt take notice of two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:118024:81"/>
Firſt, that this beauty is not naturall, neither doe we receive it from nature: for ſo we are ſhewed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. by nature we are uncleane and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, our <hi>Nativity</hi> was of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> and <hi>Hittites,</hi> Verſ. 3. And we were caſt out, as being loathed in the day of our birth, Verſ. 5. polluted in our blood, Verſ. 6. but,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is a ſupernaturall beauty: Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorts us, <hi>to put on the new man,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. He uſeth the metaphor of putting on, to ſhew unto us, that thoſe graces of the new man are as ſo many venuſt and beautifull Ornaments to our ſouls. Thus the Lord put excellent Ornaments upon his Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 7. and covered her nakedneſſe, Verſ. 8. waſhed away her blood, Verſ. 9. decked and adorned her with Chaines and Jewells, &amp;c. and ſo ſhee came to be <hi>exceeding beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in his eyes, Verſ. 10. 13. The Church ſhines in the bright beams of Chriſt's excellency, her beauty is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative beauty, which flows on her from the Fountain of beauty; as the members ſhine in the glory of their head, and as the wife ſhines in the glory of her Huſband; ſo Chriſtians ſhine in the glory of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve, <hi>That the Saints are moſt faire in Chriſt's eyes, when they are moſt deformed in their owne.</hi> The Church as being privy to her owne deformities, calleth her ſelfe <hi>black,</hi> Verſ. 5. but here Chriſt calleth her <hi>fair,</hi> yea, <hi>the faireſt among women:</hi> and in Verſ. 15. he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth her beauty. The Church is never more faire then when ſhee judgeth her ſelfe to be moſt deformed; never more happy then when ſhee accounteth her ſelfe moſt miſerable; never more holy then when ſhee reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons her ſelfe moſt of all polluted: ſhee is never richer then when ſhee ſees her ſelfe to be pooreſt of all: for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118024:82"/>
the ſence of miſery, poverty, deformity and weakneſſe is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the firſt mover, as it were, that cauſeth us to looke for help from another; when we are ſenſible of evill, then we run to the fountaine of good: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>When I am weake then am I ſtrong,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10. That is, when I am weake in my ſelfe, I am ſtrong in Chriſt, and when I am weake in the fleſh I am ſtrong in the Spirit. And in Verſ. 9. <hi>His ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not meane in thus ſpeaking, that the ſtrength or vertue of God can be either increaſed or diminiſhed; but then it is ſaid to be perfect, when it manifeſteth it ſelfe to the full, and demonſtrateth that nothing can overcome or conquer it: the greater the infirmities of the Saints are, and the greater their aſſaults and temptations are, the greater and ſtronger doth that power and vertue appear to be, that ſupporteth them under ſuch infirmities and temptations: So that when our weakneſſe doth moſt appeare, the perfection of Gods ſtrength is moſt ſeene. Thus it is Chriſt doth not eſteeme of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more at one time then at another, but onely the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in the making out of his love to us; and there is never ſo much of the beauty of Chriſt ſeene in us, as then, when we ſee our ſelves moſt deformed.</p>
                     <p>Now from this ſweet compellation, and moſt amiable forme of Speech, <hi>O thou faireſt among women,</hi> Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to give his Church direction.</p>

                     <p>Some read it, <hi>Of the flocks;</hi> and indeed the word <hi>Tſon</hi> lacketh the Plurall number in forme of declenſion, but not in ſenſe and ſignification: ſo that it may be taken either Singularly or Plurally, according as the words will beare. But I rather here take it in the ſingular number, becauſe Chriſt doth oppoſe his owne, onely flock, unto the flocks of his companions: as he himſelf being that onely great Shepheard, is oppoſed to his companions, and generally Chriſt hath one flock and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118024:83"/>
one fold, <hi>John</hi> 10. 16. And he calleth his Church <hi>his flock, and the flock of his paſture,</hi> Ezek. 34. 22, 23. And in <hi>Song 6. 9. My Dove</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and my undefiled is but one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the flock being the Saints whom we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, their footſteps are their faith and obedience; for ſo we are taught to <hi>walke in the footſteps of the faith of our father Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 12. And ſo of all the godly that went before us: the Author to the Hebrews ſaith, <hi>That by faith the Elders obtained a good report,</hi> Heb. 11. 2. That is, they left a good report or example behind them. And in Chap. 12. 1. he calleth them <hi>a cloud of Witneſſes:</hi> by which expreſſion the Apoſtle ſeems to allude to that cloud whereby the Children of Iſrael were led and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected withall, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21. So that as that cloud guided the Children of Iſrael from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo this cloud of witneſſes, towit, that multitude of the faithfull that went before us, may direct us, as by their example, in the holy and ſpirituall wayes of Jeſus Chriſt. And thus the Apoſtle expoſtulates with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Walked we not in the ſame Spirit, walked we not in the ſame ſteps:</hi> towit, that <hi>Titus</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. So that to walke in the ſame ſteps with the Saints, is to walke in the ſame faith, in the ſame Spirit, in the ſame obedience with them.</p>
                     <p>Now by a little recapitulation you may take the words yet a little more fully thus: <hi>Goe forth for thy ſelfe, or get thee forth:</hi> That is, from thy blackneſſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, get thee out of thy ſelfe, out of the world, out of thy former courſe, put thy ſelfe forward, ſet not up thy reſt here, but up and be doing; be not alwayes to ſeek, but, <hi>goe forth by the footſteps of the flocke,</hi> in the footſteps of former Chriſtians, <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of all

the Prophets and Apoſtles.

                     <p>Secondly, we may underſtand theſe to be the true Shepheards of Jeſus Chriſt, which of old fed the flock of God, as many Scriptures reſtifie. <hi>Pſal. 77. 21.

Now if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words according to this Interpretation, then we muſt read them thus, <hi>Feed thy Kids with,</hi> or <hi>near the Shepheards Tents:</hi> that is, bring thy young and weak Chriſtians to thoſe that are the Shepheards of Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Lord hath indued with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſdome and underſtanding, to feed, guide, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them. We may take the words in either of theſe ſenſes, for they both hold forth one and the ſame thing, towit, that the Lambs of Chriſt, the members of his Church, ſhould not be fed with huſks and Hogs-meat, of the inventions of mans braine, and with the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118024:85"/>
ceremonies of falſe Churches, but with the pure and wholſome food of Chriſt's word and doctrine, and with Ordinances and Laws of the King of <hi>Sion;</hi> they ſhould be fed, guided, preſerved, and governed by Chriſt alone. The words being thus explained, let us gather ſome Obſervations from them.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, in that Chriſt directeth his Church to goe forth from her blackneſſe, ignorance, and ſuperſtition. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſtians are not to ſit downe under, but to ariſe and depart from ſin, ignorance, and ſuperſtition.</hi> Firſt, they are to goe out of former evills of blackneſſe and ignorance unto purity and ſaving knowledge: Thus did <hi>Paul</hi> at his Converſion, turne from perſecuting the Church of Chriſt, and fell to preach Chriſt. And thus the Apoſtle exhorts the whole Church, <hi>To lift up the hands which hang downe, and the feeble knees, and make ſtrait paths for their feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed,</hi> Heb. 12. 12, 13. That is, they ought not to yield and give over becauſe of the ſharpneſſe of affliction, but lift up their hands as men ready to fight, and their feet as men ready to run, <hi>and make ſtraight paths for their feet, Leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way.</hi> That is, leaſt by yeilding to the temptation, they that are weake ſeek by-paths, for avoiding the danger thereof, whereas they ſhould by ſtrengthening their hands, quit themſelves, and walke in a ſtraight and even path. And we are exhorted <hi>to abhorre that which is evill, and cleave to that which is good,</hi> Rom. 12. 9. We muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ſin and blackneſſe, and cleave to that which is good and comely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:118024:85"/>
Secondly, Chriſtians muſt goe forth from one degree of grace to another; they muſt not reſt in their firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of grace, of wiſdome, and of knowledge, but proceed by making an addition thereunto. And ſo <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael went from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 84. That is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their ſtrength daily more and more: like to this ſaith the Apoſtle, we are changed into the image of God, <hi>from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. That is, from grace to grace, from one degree of perfection unto another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the image of God be perfectly reſtored in us, by the Spirit of the Lord. And Gods juſtice is revealed <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. to the increaſing of faith more and more. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that the path of the juſt <hi>ſhineth more and more unto a perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18. His light ſhall increaſe untill it come to perfection. Hence it is that the Apoſtle prays, that the faith of the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> might be <hi>perfect,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3. 10. The word in the Originall here Tranſlated <hi>perfect,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>make even,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> The word ſignifies to make even or to ſet that which is out of joint or dillocuted, &amp; ſo make it ſound &amp; perfect.</note> becauſe an even number is a perfect number, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſignifies perfection alſo: the Apoſtle deſires they may be more and more confirmed in their faith, untill they come to perfection.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſtians are not onely to goe forth from that which is evill unto that which is good, and from the ſmaller degrees of good to greater perfections of it: but alſo from all kind of ſuperſtition and idolatry, unto pure worſhip and ſanctity. Chriſtians muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to ſit downe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but they muſt depart out from thence as the Children of Iſrael did, and to worſhip the Lord in <hi>Canaan.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is called myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> Revel. 18. 2. from whence the Lord calls his people, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. And he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Sodome,</hi> Revel. 11. 8. he is called <hi>Sodome</hi>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:118024:86"/>
for uncleanneſſe and wickedneſſe, as we may ſee in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 5. and <hi>Aegypt</hi> for oppreſſing the people of the Lord, and for idolatry. And <hi>John</hi> addeth, <hi>Where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our Lord was crucified:</hi> either he means he was Crucified under <hi>Rome's</hi> Dominion, by the authority of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or elſe Chriſt was Crucified and put to death in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in reſpect of his Saints in whom he ſuffered very much. Now the Lord calleth his people out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and out of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> That is, from their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall idolatry and ſuperſtition, and from their ſin and wickedneſſe. Thus the Lord called his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11. <hi>Depart yee, depart yee</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>goe yee out from thence, touch no uncleane thing, goe yee out of the midſt of her; be yee cleane that beare the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lord.</hi> This was an admonition from the Lord warning thoſe that were faithfull, not to pollute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Babylonian ſuperſtitions. And we have the like call from the Apoſtle, <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be yee ſeperate, ſaith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. This is meant of comming out from ſpirituall idolatry, as is apparent by <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Be not unequally yoaked,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with unbelievers:</hi> That is, be not yoked or enthralled with Heatheniſh idolatry, be not pertakers with infidells in ſuperſtition. The Greeke Scholiaſt, render it thus: <hi>Draw not downe the beame, or incline not in any part to the ſuperſtitions of the heathen.</hi> For the metaphor is taken from Beaſts, that draw both in one yoke, and the one leſſe then the other, draweth downe the burthen upon the other, which is unequall.

To this direction the Apoſtle exhorts the Saints, <hi>Be yee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of me, even as I am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1.

that (if it were poſſible) they would deceive the very Elect,</hi> Mat. 24. 23, 24.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118024:88"/>
their own conſtitutions, there is to be found wholſome food ſay they. Now what a madneſſe were it to follow ſuch ſtrange Doctrines, which are contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets; and when they can prove their Doctrine and worſhip by nothing but by their own authority: ſuch a Pope and ſo many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and Biſhops did decree this thing, and that; theſe cannot erre (ſay they) and therefore we muſt believe them. Now no wiſe man can follow after ſuch wicked companions as theſe are.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we goe to ancient Fathers, they have erred, and therefore wee cannot rely upon them. Wee may not then enquire of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Hierome, Bernard,</hi> &amp;c. For all theſe have had their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and have erred in many things: and though they ſaw much in reſpect of the ignorance of their times, yet their light was very dim: their light in compariſon to that of the Apoſtles, was but (as it were) the light of a candle, compared to the light of the Sun. And as for thoſe that are of later yeares, that were the firſt reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpel, ſince the generall Apoſtacy; as <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe performed many great things, having received ſingular gifts from God, but theſe had their failings and errours alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wee may not goe to Councels and Synods, for theſe have, and may erre likewiſe: even the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels may erre, for ſo did the Councell of <hi>Nice:</hi> therefore we cannot rely on ſynodicall determinations; but then whether ſhall we goe?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer poſitively, we muſt goe to the Scriptures, which the Apoſtle calleth a <hi>ſure word.</hi> And the holy Scriptures can only make us wiſe unto ſalvation, it is that which will <hi>make the man of God perfect,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. 16. The Apoſtle referring to the voyce heard upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118024:88"/>
the mount, when Chriſt was transfigured in glory, cals it <hi>a more ſure word of propheſie, to the which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yee will doe well to take heed,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 1. 19.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture of the Olde Teſtament ſhined in thoſe dark times, and it was a perfect rule even in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 12. 32. The Scripture is a perfect rule of faith, and of good manners: Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe giving authority to the Old Teſtament, and <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle doth approve &amp; give witneſſe to the New Teſtament, ſealing up the divine authority thereof, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 18, 19. The cauſe of miſtake in any, is the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Scriptures: this Chriſt telleth the Jewes, <hi>Yee erre</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not knowing the Scripture,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. Hence he counſelleth them <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. He alludeth to thoſe that digg deep into the earth for thoſe precious things that lie hidden in the profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity thereof; for ſuch a profound ſearch it is, that the Apoſtle doth ſo highly commend the noble <hi>Bereans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But now here ariſeth another queſtion, namely, how we ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures; for one interprets them this way, and another that way: how then ſhall we come to the right underſtanding of them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer firſt negatively, ſecondly affirmatively.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Negatively thus; no man can by wit, learning, or any humane art underſtand the Scriptures, becauſe they contain heavenly and divine myſteries in them. I grant that a man by humane learning may underſtand the literall ſenſe of the Scriptures; but he underſtands not that ſpirituall hidden myſtery therein contained; he may read the Scripture, and not underſtand, ſee, and not perceive, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declareth the ſame thing, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the preaching of the Croſſe is to them that periſh, fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> That is, it ſeemeth to them a very ridiculous and empty thing. The Apoſtle confirms this by a citation
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118024:89"/>
out of the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> Chap. 29. verſ. 14. <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the prudent,</hi> verſ. 19. That is, I will infatuate their wiſdome, and their underſtanding ſhall periſh. Now then ſaith he, <hi>where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> That is, how are all your wiſe men, and great Philoſophers, that ſpend much time in ſearching out the ſecrets of nature, but yet are ignorant of the hidden myſtery of Chriſt. The divine writings of God will not ſtoop to the ſpirit of a naturall man: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. He ſheweth that a man that hath no farther light of underſtanding then that of nature, cannot with his carnall reaſon reach the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly myſteries of the word, which muſt be underſtood in a divine and ſpirituall ſenſe. But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scriptures are a ſufficient rule, when wee come to make uſe of them, with the inward anointings of the ſpirit of Chriſt upon our hearts. And hence the Apoſtle doth comfort the Saints againſt ſeducers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>But yee have an unction from the holy one, and yee know all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20. That is, you are not in danger of being ſeduced or drawn aſide from Chriſt, becauſe the ſpirit of God, that anointed Chriſt a Prieſt &amp; King, hath alſo anointed you to be a ſpirituall Prieſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. So that ye may be able to guide and defend your ſelves againſt falſe teachers: this anointing you have received from the <hi>holy one,</hi> even from Chriſt, in whom is a ſpring of ſpirituall graces to be communicated unto us, by W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> means <hi>ye know all things</hi> needful to be known to preſerve you from being ſeduced, or led from Jeſus Chriſt. And in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. he ſaith, <hi>But the anointing which ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118024:89"/>
of him, abideth in you: and yee need not that any man ſhould teach you: but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie.</hi> Although in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things wee may teach and edifie one another; yet none can teach the mind and the affections to ſtick faſt to the truth of Chriſt, but the Spirit, which is to lead and guide us into all truth. Now the Spirit of Chriſt is the beſt Interpreter of the Scripture; the ſame ſpirit that firſt indited the Scriptures, muſt teach us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them: when wee have the ſpirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, who were pen-men of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then, and not before, ſhall wee underſtand the Scriptures. It is the Spirit of God that muſt teach us, and lead us into all truth: Hence the Apoſtle calleth the Goſpel the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. And this ſpirit is called the <hi>law of the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. And the ſpirit of <hi>adoption</hi> and freedome, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. the ſpirit of <hi>diſcerning, for it ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. The <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 13. The <hi>ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 17. Now wee muſt bring the Spirit of the Scriptures to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures, the Spirit of God to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word of God. <hi>For wiſdome will be juſtified of her children: none of the wicked ſhall have underſtanding, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand,</hi> Dan. 12. 10.</p>

Chriſt cannot content himſelfe with his happineſſe and glory, untill he hath communicated of the ſame unto his Saints. The generall love of Chriſt is ſcattered and branched out to all creatures in the world; but his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, his exceeding great and rich love is faſtned only upon his Church. Chriſt doth declare wherein hee hath manifeſted his love unto his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you,</hi> John 15 15. That is, I have in a friendly manner revealed the ſecrets of my Fathers boſome unto you, and declared unto you the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, which I ſhould not have done, if you had not been my friends. Chriſts love to his people is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Infinite and unmeaſurable, beyond all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or compariſon. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15. 9. Now who can underſtand with what love the Father hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Sonne? no more can we define and fully ſet out what is the love of Chriſt unto his Saints. The Apoſtle indeed would have the Epheſians <hi>able to comprehend with all Saints the bredth, and length, the depth, and height of the love of Chriſt:</hi> but yet for all that he concludes, that it <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 18, 19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A gracious love: <hi>I will heal their backeſliding, I will love them freely, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 3. Wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to invite Chriſt to love us; but his love is free, without the leaſt deſert at all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A liberall and a bountiful love: Chriſt hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that for his people, which was moſt deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, the ſoule in his body, the blood in his veines, and (which was more deare unto him then all the reſt) the ſweet and raviſhing apprehenſions of his Fathers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118024:92"/>
love, which was ſo ecclipſed in his agonies, that hee cryed out with a loud voyce, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> It is reported of the Pelican, that ſhee openeth her breaſt with her bill, and feedeth her young ones with the blood diſtilling from her: and therefore (ſaith mine Author) the Aegyptians uſed to make that kind an Hieroglyphick of piety and pitty; and upon that conſideration they ſpared them at their Tables. Such, and far greater is Chriſt's love to his Saints; for ſaith he, <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> John 15. 13. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that he <hi>loved his Church, and gave himſelfe for it,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An eternall love is Chriſt's towards his Church. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting kindneſs,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. And again he ſaith, <hi>with everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy upon thee.</hi> Though the Saints are black and deformed, though they have been negligent and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; yet Chriſt doth not leſſen or detract his love from them: but ſtill he gives them this Epithite, <hi>O my beloved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>How ſhould this warm and kindle all our affections unto him again: Chriſt's love ſhould be a load-ſtone attractive to draw our love unto him: there is nothing doth more conciliate and attract love, then love it ſelf. Hence it is the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have drawn them with loving kindneſſe,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. Surely if love will not draw out our affection to Jeſus Chriſt, nothing will. Oh what an infinite and wonderfull love is it, that majeſtie and love ſhould dwell together in the heart of Chriſt! Chriſt doth much condiſcend in his love to us: ſo that here is the greateſt Majeſtie, and the greateſt debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever was, met in Chriſt, and all out of love to poor ſoules.</p>

covers his neck, and ſhews his courage: he is ſo fierce, as if hee would devour and ſwallow down the ground under him. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The horſe is prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of battle,</hi> Prov. 21. 31.</p>

Now by this compariſon Chriſt ſetteth forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and renown of his Church in reſpect of her victories and achievements; for he having directed his Church to follow the foot-ſteps of the Flock, and to feed above the tents of falſe Shepheards, no queſtion now but theſe falſe Shepheards, who before were called Chriſt's companions, will perſecute and afflict her: now for the comforting and ſupporting of her, Chriſt tells her, ſhee ſhall be ſtrong and victorious, ſhe ſhall be like <hi>the horſes</hi> of Aegypt, ready for the battell. And thus when the Lord threatneth wars againſt the daughters of Sion, he ſaith, <hi>The ſhepheards with their flocks ſhall come unto her, they ſhall pitch their tents againſt her round about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 2, 3. Now the Lord to comfort his Church againſt the fury of theſe falſe ſhepheards, compareth her to the horſes in <hi>Pharaoh's chariots;</hi> wherein hee ſheweth, that his Church ſhould be ſtrong, cheerefull, prompt, and ready for the warre, ſhee ſhould be valiant and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thus the Lord promiſeth victory to his Church, againſt thoſe falſe ſhepheards which ſhould ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, in <hi>Zach.</hi> 10. 3. hee ſaith, (by a like ſimile) <hi>mine anger was kindled againſt the ſhepheards, and I puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goats; for the Lord of hoſts hath viſited his flocke, the houſe of Iudah, and hath made them as his goodly horſe in the battell,</hi> &amp;c. Hence they ſhall obtaine the victory over their enemies, and therefore he addeth in <hi>verſ. 5.

ſuch valour and ſtrength, ſo that of Sheep they ſhall become great War-horſes, with which the Lord will overcome and trample downe his enemies.

                     <p>It was an Ornament of honour and dignity, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe Eaſterne Countries, to weare Chaines of gold, or of pearle or of pretious ſtones. This word

                        <hi>Charuzim</hi> is not found in any other place of Scripture beſides this, and is Tranſlated <hi>collars</hi> or <hi>chains,</hi> and it ſignifies a Chaine of pearle or pretious ſtone; when many pearles are drawne together upon one thred, and made into one chaine and ſo put about the neck.</p>
                     <p>Now it is queſtionable whither this ſimilitude of <hi>rows</hi> and <hi>chains</hi> is to be referred to the Church, as ſhee was compared to the Horſes in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Chariot, Ver. 9. or to a woman as ſhee was a Shepheardeſſe in Verſ. 8.

                     <p>Firſt, we may refer theſe <hi>rows</hi> and <hi>chains</hi> unto the Church, as ſhee was compared to the Horſes of <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,</hi> taking it thus: Chriſt had decked and trimmed her, even as great Princes doe adorne their horſe bridles, he alludeth, no doubt, to the manner of thoſe Eaſterne Princes, who uſed to trim their bridles, &amp; other kinds of furniture for the forepart of their Horſes, with ſundry kinds of Ornaments, as gold, pearle, pretious ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As we may ſee in <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 21. 26. The King of <hi>Midian</hi> had Ornaments of Chains of gold, and pearle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about his Camel's neck. Now by this compariſon he meaneth, that there was no greater glory nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in theſe things, then was in the outward parts and members of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Or if we retaine the ſimilitude of a woman, it is meant of eare-rings and Jewells which adorne the face; as we have it in the Prophet, <hi>I have decked thee with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, I put Bracelets upon thine hands, and a chaine on thy neck, and I put a Jewell on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thy eares, and a beautifull crowne upon thine head, thus waſt thou decked with Gold and ſilver, and thou waſt exceeding beautifull,</hi> &amp;c.

Now the ſpirituall ſignification is one and the ſame, according to either ſimilitude.

                     <p>Theſe <hi>rows</hi> and <hi>chains</hi> ſignifie the Ordinances &amp; whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Laws of God, which were binding like chains, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective to guide the Church, as his <hi>goodly horſe in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,</hi> Zech. 10. 3. and being managed and guided by Chriſt ſhee might overcome all her enemies. And all the Ordinances of Chriſt were as ſo many Ornaments of Jewells, and chains of gold, to adorne the face and neck of the Church; and alſo by her conformity and obedience to them, ſhee becomes beautifull in the eyes of Chriſt, and in the eyes of all his people.</p>

                     <p>The doctrines, inſtructions, and councells of Chriſt, received by his Church, are as ſo many Ornaments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, even as Pearles and Jewells are Ornaments in the Bridles of Horſes.

                        <hi>That Chriſt hath not onely indowed his people with inward ſtrength and valour, but alſo with outWard glory and beauty.</hi> In the former Verſe he compared her unto <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Charriot Horſes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Againe, the effectuall teaching and Revelation of the glorious Goſpell is attributed to the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, as a joint worke belonging to them all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Father revealeth the Myſtery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: thus Chriſt tels <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Mat. 16. 17.

And therefore is ſaid to be <hi>a Teacher ſent from God,</hi> John 3. 2. And <hi>the Lord which ſpeaketh from Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The holy Ghoſt is alſo a revealer of theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto men; hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11. And therefore it is called <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. <hi>the revelation of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 17. And <hi>no man can call Jeſus Lord but by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 1. And ſo for the ſending of the holy Spirit, the Comforter, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſaid to ſend the holy Spirit. <hi>For I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:118024:98"/>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and he ſhall ſend you another comforter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. 26. And Chriſt ſaith, that he will ſend the Comforter. <hi>Iohn 15. 26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend you from the Father,</hi> &amp;c. The Father ſends the Spirit in Chriſts name, and Chriſt ſends him from (or in the name of) the Father.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Comforter is ſaid to come of himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7. Thus it was in the creation of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Elohim created the heaven and the earth.</hi> In which place the verb <hi>bara,</hi> being of the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, doth ſignifie the moſt ſimple eſſence of God: and the Subſtantive, <hi>Elohim,</hi> being of the plurall number, notes out unto us, the Father, Sonne, and Spirit. So all the works of creation, redemption, calling, glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are joyntly, and alſo variouſly and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly attributed to the Father, Son, and Spirit. So here, <hi>we will make,</hi> &amp;c. The Father, Son, and Spirit do joyntly work in the adorning of the ſoule. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That workes of grace are very glorious works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The excellency of the worker ſets forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the work: God made all things very good at the firſt: And as for man, <hi>let us</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>make him in our owne image</hi> (which phraſe in <hi>our image,</hi> ſignifieth the unity of the eſſence of God) now this image was very glorious, and is called <hi>the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 1.</p>
                     <p>Now all the works of God are glorious: <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy-worke,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. But much more glorious is the work of grace, or the new creation made upon the ſoule, which is the renewing of it, according <hi>to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118024:99"/>
of God,</hi> Col. 3. 10. And a <hi>changing of the ſoule into the ſame image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. This image is a glorious image, and it is a glorious work to frame it upon the ſoule. This work is ſo glorious, that it commends the work-man and framer thereof; and the worker of this grace is ſo glorious, that his worth magnifies the works that he doth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That all our graces, both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and encreaſings of them, are from God.</hi> Chriſt is called <hi>the beginner and finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. He is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt contriver, and the laſt finiſher of all our work: <hi>hee that hath begun a good worke in us,</hi> is the ſame, that muſt <hi>perfect that worke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of Chriſt. Every good gift,</hi> as alſo the increaſe thereof, <hi>is from God,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. The Apoſtle attributes all praiſe to him, <hi>that is able to doe exceedingly abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above all that we aske or thinke, according to the power that worketh in us,</hi> Eph. 3. 20. It is a magnificent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that worketh in us, and that power only can worke abundantly more for us. As our bodies came naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, ſo did our ſoules, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4. It is the Lord that decketh and adorneth us with grace, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. 14. It is from Chriſt we muſt receive <hi>gold</hi> to enrich us, and <hi>white raiment to cloath us,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. We put on the new man, as garments, which are additions to our nature, given us of Chriſt; wee are poore, it is hee that doth enrich us; naked, he cloaths us; deformed, he beautifies us; miſerable, he makes us happy: in a word, he works all our works for us.</p>

As an ear-ring of gold, with an ornament of fine gold, ſo is a wiſe reprover upon an obedient eare.</hi> Which doth declare unto us, that reproofs well given, and well taken, are as beautifull ornaments unto the Saints.</p>
                     <p>Or wee may underſtand it of the glorious Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and graces, that ſhould be diſpenſed in the times of the Goſpel, and how they ſhould far exceed thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ordinances under the Law: according to this the Lord ſpeaks in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 17. <hi>For braſſe I will bring gold, &amp; for iron I will bring ſilver, and for wood, braſſe, &amp; for ſtones iron,</hi> &amp;c. This was a promiſe, that the Lord in the dayes of the Goſpel would make all things better, and make a through-alteration of Ordinances; hee would demoliſh all carnall Ordinances, and ſet up thoſe that are ſpirituall. We may underſtand the words to be a promiſe of a new ſupply of graces and ſtrength, that Chriſt would give unto his Church; or of the glorious ordinances and graces diſpenſed unto the Saints in the days of the Goſpel: all thoſe carnall Ordinances of meats and drinks, and diverſe waſhings ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a more ſpirituall adminiſtration. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118024:100"/>
telleth us that thoſe rites and ordinances under the Law, <hi>ſtood only in meats and drinks, and diverſe waſhings, and carnall ordinances impoſed on them, untill the time of reformation,</hi> Hebr. 9. 10. The Apoſtle ſums up all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall rites and ſhadows whatſoever, calling them <hi>carnall ordinances,</hi> of juſtifications of the fleſh, becauſe they did ſanctifie only to the purifying of the fleſh, freeing of thoſe who uſed them from legall pollutions: And ſaith he, theſe were impoſed <hi>untill the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that is, untill Chriſt came in the fleſh, who ſhould reform all ſuch carnall rites and ceremonies, with all thoſe legal obſervations &amp; ſervices, exhibiting the truth and reality of ſpirituall things ſignified by them, and by inſtituting a more holy and ſpirituall worſhip. We may take either of the two laſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, either of the encreaſe of grace unto the church then preſent, or of thoſe plentiful meaſures of grace, and ſpirituall adminiſtrations under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if wee take the meaning of the words for an increaſe of grace, oberve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That where ever the Lord begins a work of grace, hee doth adde new ſupplies of grace to ſuch beginnings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is that the Apoſtle was very confident of in behalfe of the <hi>Philippians: That hee that had begun a good worke in them, would finiſh it untill the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 6. And he ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Chriſt is the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> When God had made the world, he did not ceaſe from exerciſing his power; but it is ſtill at work for the upholding of the creation: ſo concerning the work of the new Creation, I mean the work of grace in the ſoule: Chriſt doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this work, or work ſome ſmall degrees of it, but he doth proceed to maintain what he hath begun, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:118024:101"/>
to encreaſe that which he maintains, and to perfect what he doth encreaſe, carrying the ſoule from glory to glory.</p>
                     <p>2. If wee underſtand the words of thoſe glorious things, that were to be exhibited by Chriſt in the time of the Goſpel</p>
                     <p>Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Doctrine of faith, and ordinances of the Goſpell, with the graces accompanying them, are much more glorious and excellent, then thoſe under the law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This glorious Goſpel the Apoſtle ſets forth at large in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. unto <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>But if the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of death written and engraven in ſtones, were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>how ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be more glorious.</hi> He calleth the law the miniſtry of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the letter killeth, becauſe it doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate an ability to man to keep the ſame, neither makes any promiſe of forgiveneſſe unto the tranſgreſſor; for tſte tenour of it runs thus: <hi>Curſed is every one that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in all the things which are written in the law.</hi> It convinceth us of ſinne, and therefore it's called the miniſtration of death and condemnat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on: but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the miniſtration of the Spirit, and of life and righteouſneſs; becauſe the Goſpel doth not only ſhew the way to life by Chriſt, but it is accompanied with the power of the holy Spirit, whereby wee are raiſed from the death of ſinne, and quickned to the life of holineſſe; and it doth alſo crown us with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, adminiſtring the ſame unto us by Jeſus Chriſt. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>verſ. 10. For that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</hi> That is, all thoſe legall adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had ſome kind of glory upon them, yet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:118024:101"/>
they had no glory comparatively: as the light of a candle ſhines very bright in the night, but it is obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the day-time; ſo is the light of the Moone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the light of the Sunne, ſo likewiſe is the glory of the Law obſcured by the light of the Goſpel, that it ſeems to have no glory or light at all.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the law was glorious in two reſpects eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the promulgation of it, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhewes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 19. There was <hi>fire, and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt, and the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the voyce of words,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord came in great Majeſtie to give the Law, even as the Kings of the earth do put on their garments of State when they goe to enact Laws: but Chriſt diſcovered more glory upon the Mount; at his transfiguration, there was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and the voyce of God from heaven, and the appearance of the holy Ghoſt deſcending upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence it is, the glory of Mount-<hi>Sion</hi> exceeds the glory of Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the matter of the Law, it was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: it contained the image and glory of God, which at firſt was ſtamped upon mans heart, and after writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the tables of ſtone; but now the Goſpel holds forth this image as ſtamped upon Chriſt, and ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us again. This the Apoſtle teſtifies unto us in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. ſaying, <hi>Leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine into their hearts.</hi> And Chriſt is called the <hi>expreſſe forme or image of his perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. This is ſpoken not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his divine nature, but alſo in regard that hee is God manifeſt in the fleſh, by whom the glory and righteouſneſſe, grace, mercy, goodneſſe, wiſddome
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118024:102"/>
and power of God is revealed unto us.</p>
                     <p>Again the Apoſtle telleth us, that the glory of the miniſtration excelleth that of the law, becauſe that of the law is to be done away, and that of the Goſpel was to remain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. All thoſe carnall rites and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Law were to be aboliſhed; and the Lord promiſes that in their ſtead, he wil <hi>create new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new earth: and the former ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or come into mind,</hi> Iſa. 65. 17. The Lord would ſo alter and change the ſtate of his Church, that it ſhall ſeem to be a new world: and the ſpirituall excellency thereof ſhall ſo much exceed that which was before, that the conſideration of the one, ſhall ſeem to drown and aboliſh the memory of the other. The Apoſtle doth argue the aboliſhing of the old Ordinances, and the continuance of the new, thus: <hi>In that he ſaith a new covenant</hi> (ſpeaking of the promiſe of God) <hi>hee hath made the firſt old: now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh away,</hi> Heb. 8. 13. That is, the old le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall adminiſtration ſhall be diſannulled, or abrogated at the comming in of that which is new.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, in the times of reſtauration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, all things ſhall be altered for the better, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 26. <hi>The light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven dayes,</hi> &amp;c. That is, every adminiſtration of the Goſpel ſhall farre exceed in glory and light all thoſe of the Law. And in this reſpect the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Sun and the Moon ſhall be aſhamed, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall rule in Zion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 23. That is, the light and glory of the Sun, and of the Moon ſhall be darkneſſe in compariſon of the light and glory of God, that ſhall ſhine in his Church under the Goſpel. See alſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:118024:102"/>
60. 19, 20. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thy ſun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſſe ſhall the Moone give light unto thee, but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory: thy Sun ſhall no more goe downe, neither ſhall thy Moone withdraw it ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> If we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words of the firſt times of the Goſpell, then by the Sun and Moone we muſt underſtand all legall rites and ſhaddows, which were the lights of thoſe times. But if we underſtand the laſt reſtoration of the Goſpell, which ſhall be after the generall Apoſtacy, and falling away, by reaſon of the over-ſpreading of the darkneſſe of Antichriſt. I ſay if it be meant of this laſt reſtoration, then we muſt underſtand by the Sun and Moone all outward and worldly meanes, whereby God hath conveyed any light unto his people: ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and worldly meanes ſhall ceaſe, and the Lord will communicate light and grace into the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by ſome higher, and ſome more ſpirituall way, then he hath done formerly.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for Chriſt's embraceing, commending, and promiſing unto his Church, wherein he ſets forth her excellency in reſpect of the time then preſent, and alſo in reſpect of the time to come. Now it followeth that the Church doth endeavour to ſet forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of her Beloved.</p>

                        </note> come. The Table that theſe ſit at is to be conſidered according to the place, and that is two-fold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The place of Chriſt's ſiting may be meant of Heaven; and if ſo, then it ſets forth the wonderfull ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, even whilſt he is in the Heavens; then the ſence would be as much as if the Church ſhould ſay, now while the King ſits in Heaven, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with his holy Angells, and I here on Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, there is a wonderfull diſtance between us, and yet his ſweet ſavour commeth unto me; yea, I doe ſmell his ſweetneſſe though at a great diſtance, even as it were the precious <hi>Spiknard, Myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>Camphyre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may take it for Chriſt's feaſting with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple while they are here on Earth; of his ſpirituall Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet with his Saints, feeding them with his word and graces: for thus he ſaith, <hi>Behold Iſtand at the doore and knocke, if any man heare my voice and open, I will come in and ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> Revel. 3. 20. This ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall communion that Chriſt hath with his Church, is called, <hi>The Table of the Lord,</hi> Mal. 1. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. and it ſignifies that bleſſed, ſweet, and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betweene Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there is a mutuall feaſting betwixt Chriſt and his Church.</hi> The unity and communion that we have with Chriſt is ſet forth to us, in our ſiting downe with Chriſt at his Table, to the end we may partake with him of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118024:104"/>
his ſpirituall dainties, and heavenly Manna, with which he feeds and refreſheth his Saints. It is moſt true, that we have nothing to invite or welcome Chriſt, but he ſends proviſion of his owne, and comes (as we uſe to ſay) at his owne coſt; he firſt ſends a ſpirit of faith, a ſpirit of love, a ſpirit of holineſſe, a ſpirit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and then comes and makes a feaſt of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as himſelfe ſends. Now what ever may be ſaid in the praiſe and commendations of a plentifull Feaſt, the ſame and much more may be ſaid in the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of this Feaſt that Chriſt makes for his Saints.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Feaſts there are the chiefeſt proviſions of meat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in Chriſt we have the chiefeſt food in all the World. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. 55. That is, his fleſh is that ſpirituall Manna that came downe from Heaven, with which our ſouls are fed to eternall life. The Crucified fleſh of Chriſt, by which divine juſtice was ſatisfied, is the onely meat to refreſh our ſouls: what greater rarity is there in all the World for the ſoul to feed on, then the graces of Chriſts ſpirit, flowing out abundantly upon our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Feaſt hath all ſorts of proviſions: So Chriſt is variety of food unto the ſouls of his people. <hi>All the promiſes are yea, and in him amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. There are promiſes ſuitable to every condition and relation of his people: there is moſt pretious and pure blood to waſh away their guilt, there is ſtrength to ſupport them in weakneſſe, there is a Garment of righteouſneſſe to cover the ſhame of their nakedneſſe, a Spirit of truth to lead and guide them into all truth; ſweet mercies and conſolations to comfort them in all their droopings;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118024:105"/>
Gold, and Pearles, and pretious ſtones to enrich them. In a word, there is a plenitude and fullneſſe of all grace to feed and fill, their empty and deſtitute ſouls. And thus we have the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. leaſt we ſhould not be too much caſt downe with our owne folly, ſaith <hi>Chriſt is made unto us of God, wiſdome;</hi> and for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and corruption, he is made unto us <hi>holineſſe and ſanctification:</hi> and for our miſery and bondage he is made unto us <hi>redemption.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Chriſt, and did ſolemnly deſigne him to be home unto every Saints condition, and to be made (as the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe) <hi>all things to all men: Hee was anointed to preach glad tidings to the meeke, to bind up the broken hearts, to proclaime liberty to captives: to appoint beauty for aſhes, joy for mourning, and garments of feſtivity and praiſe for ſad and heavy ſpirits,</hi> Iſa. 61. 1, 2, 3. So that Chriſt hath in him ſufficiency relative and ſuitable to all the conditions of the Saints, they may feed on him with all ſorts and varieties of good things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In Feaſts there is great plenty of Meats and Drinks, and ſuch like proviſions, ſo that none uſe to goe away hungry from a Feaſt. So there is abundance of ſatisfaction in Chriſt; yea, in him is a redundancy and an overflowing of all good things: when Chriſt giveth his people good things, he gives them in abundance. As for our redemption, the Apoſtle ſaith we have it <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. That is, we have a full and bountifull redemption by him. And the glory that Chriſt gives to his people is cal'd <hi>riches of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 16. And Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to give us all things richly to injoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17. And to <hi>powre his Spirit richly into our hearts,</hi> Titus 3. 6. If Chriſt gives of his Spirit, he gives abundance of it; if he gives us peace, he gives
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118024:105"/>
it in abundance, yea, he fills the ſoule with good things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Feaſt is intended for joy and rejoycing; So Chriſt doth rejoyce and make glad the hearts of his people: he feeds them with inward tranquillity and joy in the holy Ghoſt, ſhedding abroad his owne love in their ſouls. It is true that the world feeds the Saints with the bread of affliction, but Chriſt gives them to drinke the wine of conſolation: <hi>In the world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>yee ſhall have tribulation, but be of good cheere I have overcome the world,</hi> John 16. 33. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle exhorteth Believers to rejoyce, in <hi>Phil. 4. 4. Rejoyce alwayes in the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you have the true cauſe of joy, you may take it upon good grounds, and therefore <hi>I ſay againe rejoyce.</hi> Chriſt doth make a feaſt of triumph and rejoycing with every ſoule that is brought home unto him, an inſtance whereof we have in the Prodigall Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24. The Father of the Prodigall brought his fatted Calfe and kill'd it, to eat &amp; make merry with his Friends. O what greater joy and rejoycing can there be then that ſweet harmony betweene the ſoule and God reconciled unto it through Jeſus Chriſt! The ſoule that was dead is now alive, and that was loſt is now found, and ſweetly entertained by the Father: what peace and joy is like that which flows from the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. At a Feaſt there is a meeting of many friends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: So here is a good company at Chriſts Table, it is ſurrounded by Chriſt and all his faithfull Servants. The Father himſelfe is preſent at this Feaſt, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with the Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 1. 3. The Saints being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt by faith, have fellowſhip with him, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:118024:106"/>
by him they are united to the Father, whereby they have communion with him alſo. The Angells are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at this feaſt, rejoycing with the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Maſter of a Feaſt doth uſe to welcome and cheare up his Gueſts. It was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to welcome their Gueſts by powring out precious Oiles upon their heads, as appeareth in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 46. &amp; John 12. 3. Hence it is, that <hi>David</hi> alluding to the Jewiſh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ſaith, <hi>Thou prepareſt my Table, and thou anointeſt my head with Oile,</hi> Pſal. 23. 5. Thus Chriſt as the Maſter of this heavenly Feaſt, cheereth up his Gueſts by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth the Oile of grace, and of gladneſſe upon the heads of his people, and by filling of their hearts with joy and gladneſſe. Thus we find Chriſt welcomming of his Church, in <hi>Song</hi> 5. 1. ſaying, <hi>Eat O my friends, drinke yee, drinke abundantly, O Beloved.</hi> Thus Chriſt feaſteth with his people, and conveyeth all the dainties of ſalvation unto them; and thus his people come to injoy Chriſt, and all his comforts and graces; here they have a Feaſt of grace, and at laſt ſhall come to a Feaſt of glory.</p>

                        </gap>t: And then wee may underſtand the graces of Chriſt in the Saints, as the fruits of faith, love, and all the ſacrifices of prayers and praiſes of the Saints: theſe and many ſuch like fruits the Saints ſhew forth by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their communion with Chriſt. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. ſets forth this communion of the Saints with Chriſt, under an elegant metaphor, repreſenting unto us, that as Plants engraffed, do receive moyſture, juyce, and nouriſhment from the ſtock, whereby they ſprout out, budd, and bear fruit: ſo the Saints, being as it were in ſerted into Chriſt, doe receive vigour and life from him, whereby they walke in the ſpirit, and become ſpirituall, holy, gracious, &amp; active in all good works. Now good and gracious works flowing from the Spirit of Chriſt, are called fruits, which ſignifie not only an iſſuing from the ſtock, but the ſweetneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of them. And thus the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>A good name is better then ointment,</hi> Eccl. 7. 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a good ſavour with it: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Yee have made us ſtincke before Pharaoh and his ſervants:</hi> That is, in their credit, good name, and eſtimation. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Prov. 15. 8. The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> That thing is moſt abominable to the Lord, which the wicked think to be moſt excellent, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118024:107"/>
whereby they think to be moſt of all accepted: but the prayers and praiſes of the godly are delightfull in his eares, they have the ſavour of a ſweet odour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, obſerve hence from the firſt interpretation,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the graces which are in Chriſt, cast a ſweet odour and perfume into the hearts of all believers. Ointment and perfume rejoyce the heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27. 9. So all Chriſts graces, which are the anointings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon him, are ſweet, rejoycing the hearts of the Saints. Chriſt was anointed with the oile of gladneſſe above his fellows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. His graces were matter of joy and gladneſſe to himſelfe, and to all his Saints. Chriſt's <hi>love is better then wine,</hi> becauſe it revives, ſtrengthens, and refreſheth the hearts of his ſervants. All Chriſts graces are very fragrant and redolent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the ſences of the ſoule; his very word and Goſpel is a <hi>ſavour of life unto life,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, according to the latter interpretation, obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the graces of the Saints are very ſavoury and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their graces are delightfull,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. To God.</item>
                        <item>2. To Man.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. They are delightfull to God, as being the fruits of his own Spirit: God loves and delights in none but in himſelfe; but when hee communicates any of the graces of his Spirit, they are part of himſelfe, and hee greatly delights in them. As a Father delights in his Child, becauſe he ſeeth part of himſelfe in his Child: ſo the Lord conveyeth his owne grace and image into
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118024:108"/>
our hearts, and then delights to ſee them there</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The graces of faith, love, prayer, and praiſes of the Saints are acceptable to God by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, his preaching of the Goſpel was <hi>unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 15. Hee alludeth to the ointment of the Prieſt, and the ſweet incenſe which they offered unto the Lord. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayeth, that his prayer might be directed before the Lord, <hi>as incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141. 2. He meaneth ſuch <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe or perfume,</hi> which was a confection of ſweet ſpices, made after the Art of the Apothecary, pure and holy, and was by the Prieſts burned upon the golden Altar, every morning before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 34, 35, 36. Which Incenſe was a figure of the prayers of the Saints, acceptable to God, through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And thus it is ſaid of <hi>Noah's</hi> burnt-offerings, which he offered, after the deluge of waters ceaſed, that <hi>the Lord ſmelled a ſavour of reſt in them,</hi> Gen. 8. 20. And Chriſt is called that <hi>Angell that ſtood before the Altar, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a golden Cenſor, and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it, with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne,</hi> Rev. 8. 3. That is, Chriſt the Angell of Gods preſence, who had a <hi>golden Cenſor,</hi> as the High Prieſt had, to offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4. unto whom was given <hi>much incenſe,</hi> like thoſe ſweet ſpices which the Prieſts burnt upon the golden Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 34. which he was to offer with the prayers of the Saints, mingling the ſweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his own merits with their prayers, and ſo offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them up upon the golden Altar, to wit, his own ſelfe, which was figured out by that golden Altar
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118024:108"/>
upon which Incenſe was offered, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 11. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaid with gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 3. And thus hee makes our prayers acceptable unto God, that hee ſmels a ſweet ſavour in them.</p>
                     <p>2. The graces of Chriſts ſpirit in the Saints, are not only ſavoury and delightfull to God by Jeſus Chriſt, but they are ſavoury to men alſo. To this purpoſe tends that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he exhorts us to have our <hi>converſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that they which ſpeake evill of us, as of evill doers, may by our good works which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the day of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12. This odour is <hi>bonae famae,</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or ſmell of a good name: for <hi>a good name is better then ointment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 3. And this the Apoſtle calls <hi>pure religion, and undefiled before God, even the Father, to viſit the fatherleſſe and widows in their adverſity, and to keepe our ſelves unſpotted of the world,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.

According to this Interpretation the Church decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth how exceedingly ſhee ſhould be nouriſhed and fed by the ſweet adminiſtrations of Chriſt unto his Church; and that ſhee ſhould be ſpiritually nurſed with her, and receive abundance of conſolation from her, being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed together by the doctrine of the Goſpell of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

                        <hi>Myrrhe</hi> you heard was very ſweet in ſmell, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in taſt, and it was a precious ingredient in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oyle.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>All the diſpenſations of Chriſt are very ſweet and ſavory unto a beleiving ſoule.</hi> There is ſuch a kind of complacency, or well-pleaſedneſſe in the hearts of the Saints, that they doe as it were acquieſce and reſt well pleaſed in his grace and goodneſſe. It is true, Chriſt is in this world a kind of a bitter ſweet unto his Saints, as I may ſo ſay: but his ſweetneſſe doth ſwallow up all his bitterneſſe: his bitterneſſe is in the loweſt degree, but his ſweetneſſe in the ſuperlative, ſo that let his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118024:111"/>
be what they will, his Saints are never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him; yea, they take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for his ſake: and when they are weake in themſelves, then they are ſtrong in him, and more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as ſaith the Apoſtle. And thus Chriſt is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Saints upon any conditions whatſoever: Let him come with a ſmile or with a frowne; with a rod or with ſweet imbracings; in what ſhape ſoever he repreſents himſelfe, he is accepted of them. Thus it was with <hi>Peter, Lord, if it be thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bid me come unto thee on the water:</hi> So it is with the Saints, they refuſe not to venture, even upon the Boiſterous waters to goe unto Chriſt. When <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Ely</hi> of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come upon his Family. <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him doe what he will.</hi> So <hi>David, I was dumb and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not my mouth becauſe thou didest it,</hi> Pſal. 39. And <hi>Job, Though he kill me, I will truſt in him.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>the Children of God, though they walke in darkneſſe, and have no light at all, yet they will truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay themſelves upon their God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. Though Chriſt be like myrrhe, ſomewhat bitter in taſt, in reſpect of the amarulency and bitterneſſe of trouble, tentation, and the Croſſe, yet he is alſo ſweet, like a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of myrrhe, refreſhing the ſenſes of the ſoule, yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them abundance of ſweetneſſe and ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That all our comforts in Chriſt are very ſure comforts.</hi> All his graces, goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe is as a <hi>bundle,</hi> or <hi>bag of myrrhe,</hi> bound up ſafe for us. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, there <hi>is laid up for him a Crowne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. It was kept ſure for him, yet was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118024:112"/>
treaſured up for him, as we uſe to treaſure up Jewells and precious things. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, our <hi>Inheritance is reſerved in Heaven for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. Theſe things are kept ſure and certaine for us, they are not given to us, as grace was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> who might loſe it at his pleaſure; but <hi>we are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> Verſ. 5. Hence it is, the Covenant of grace and of eternity is called, <hi>The ſure mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. So are all things we have in Chriſt, very ſure and ſafe; our comforts in him are ſure comforts, our peace a ſure peace, our joy a ſure joy, and the ſweetneſſe and redolency of his graces are ſure unto us, they are in him as myrrhe bound in a bundle, or put into a bag which cannot be loſt.</p>

And as for carnall men, who mind earthly things, they have nothing but carnall joyes, and carnall comforts, and carnall injoyments, theſe and ſuch like lodge all night betweene their Breaſts, theſe take up the beſt rooms in their ſouls; but the Saints delight that Chriſt and his holy Spirit, and all the operations thereof, ſhould lie all night betweene their Breaſts, that theſe ſhould dwell, and operate in their hearts.</p>

But as the owners of the Vines would wall and fence their Vineyards in ſuch a manner, that theſe Goates or Kidds, which longing and bleating after the pleaſant plants, could not come to ſpoile them: even ſo it is with the wicked perſecutors of the world, they may ſee and cry after the Saints, and much deſire their deſtruction:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118024:115"/>
but Chriſt the owner of this Vineyard hath ſet a hedg about his Saints, as hee did about <hi>Job,</hi> ſo that Satan could not touch his ſoule: and Chriſt himſelf is a <hi>wall of fire round about his Church,</hi> Zech. 2. 5. where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt alludeth to the practice of Travailers in the Wilderneſſe, who ſurrounded themſelves with a fire, and did thereby fray away the wild beaſts, and kept them off from annoying them: Chriſt is ſuch a defence unto his people, and therefore they muſt needs be in great ſafety, who have ſuch a defence, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the attempts of the wicked againſt them.</p>
                     <p>As for theſe words of propriety and affection: <hi>My beloved is unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Having ſpoken of them in the precedent verſe, I ſhall not repeat them again but ſhall only give you two or three Obſervations from this verſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That redemption by Chriſt, and the fruits thereof are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſavoury and delightfull unto the Saints.</hi> The pardon of ſinne, and reconciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt, with that ſpiritual peace flowing from thence, with all thoſe heavenly graces that follow and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this redemption; theſe cannot but be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and precious unto the Saints, yea, and much more precious and ſweet then all <hi>camphire,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> trees are unto any worldly ſenſe. Here is, as it were, a <hi>cluſter</hi> of graces compacted together, and that do ſhine forth together moſt gloriouſly, being the very life of a Chriſtians joy and comfort. In our redemption there is, as I ſaid before, a cluſter or heap of mercies and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces compacted together, as rich mercy extended to the veſſels of mercy, the Sts are made veſſels of mercy, &amp; by redemption, theſe veſſels are filled full of mercy, mercy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118024:116"/>
is manifeſted upon them. There is alſo rich love in our redemption, in that the Father gave his Sonne to death for us: and the Son alſo gave himſelfe, and laid down his life for us; greater love then this was never ſhewn by any.</p>
                     <p>Again, Free grace doth exalt it ſelfe in this work alſo; for we were bought with a price, &amp; that not with our own, but with the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In a word, in our redemption all the attributes of God ſhine forth moſt gloriouſly; as for juſtice, it is honoured, becauſe it is ſatisfied: and for mercy, it is enlarged, and hath a portion aſwel as juſtice: his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is magnified in effecting ſuch a glorious work, and his wiſdome in finding out, and in contriving, and in finiſhing the worke of our redemption. Here are graces compact together, even as cluſters of berries on the <hi>Cyprus</hi> tree: Thus Chriſt is ſweet to his Saints, in redeeming and ſaving of them; hee is like a <hi>cluſter of camphire,</hi> or <hi>of cyprus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt will be a ſafeguard and ſhelter for his Saints in the middest of the greateſt dangers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wicked men may look down from their mountain, and behold the Saints in Chriſts vineyard, and deſire much to ſpoile thoſe tender plants, but Chriſt will be a wall of defence unto them. Thus <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the Lord to be his defence, and hee expreſſeth it nine times together, in <hi>Pſal. 18. 2. The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my rocke, and fortreſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Two names of a rock are in this verſe; the firſt is <hi>Selaugh,</hi> a firm ſtony rock; the latter is <hi>Tſur,</hi> a <hi>ſtrong</hi> or <hi>ſharp rocke:</hi> he is ſaith hee, <hi>My deliverer, my God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt, my buckler, and the horn of my ſalvation, and my high tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:118024:116"/>
A horn ſignifieth <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> Pſalm. 92. 11. and therefore they ſignifie the great Monarchs and Kings of the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 21. An high tower hath it's name in Hebrew <hi>Miſgah,</hi> which is an exaltation; that is an high Tower or Fort, wherein men are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from danger and invaſion: and he addes, <hi>my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> that is, ſaving me from all wrong and violence of men: And this is that which Chriſt hath promiſed to his Sains, <hi>never to leave them, nor forſake them,</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
                     <p>There are no leſſe then five negatives in this place, to ſtrengthen and confirm our faith in the truth of the promiſe: And it is, as if he ſhould have ſaid, I will in no wiſe, whatſoever come of it, at any time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee, mine eye ſhall be ſtill over thee, and I will watch over thee for good continually. So the Lord promiſeth to be with his people in the greateſt danger, <hi>when they paſſe through the water, and when they walke through the fire,</hi> Iſa. 43. 2. Fire and water are two moſt devouring Elements; good ſervants, but bad maſters, as we ſay; and therefore here they are put for all other perillous and dangerous kinds: Chriſt will ſave and deliver his people from them all. We read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. That <hi>the three children were caſt into the fiery furnace:</hi> but what ſaid the Tyrant? <hi>I ſee foure</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and the fourth is like the Sonne of God.</hi> And in all probability it was ſo, it being uſuall under the Old Teſtament for Chriſt upon ſome weighty occaſions to appeare in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape. Thus Chriſt will be with his people in the furnace of affliction, and either he will preſerve them in, or deliver them out of trouble; hee will ſo ſanctifie affliction, that it ſhall prove a very bleſſing unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:118024:117"/>
3. From the note of propriety, <hi>my beloved is unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints only have the right feeling and ſenſe of Chriſts ſweetneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They only are redeemed and ſanctified by Chriſt, they alone feele the free remiſſion of ſins, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt: from whence ariſeth this ſweet refreſhing peace and ſpirituall joy in their ſouls. The men of the world doe ſmell the ſweet ſavour of many earthly things, and doe abundantly delight in them; but this divine and ſpirituall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt they do not ſmell.</p>
                     <p>This is no great wonder neither; for let the ſun ſhine never ſo bright, and yet hee that is blind cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. So let him that is without ſenſe of ſmelling come among ſweet ſavours, yet he ſmelleth no ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all: Thus Chriſt is preached abroad in the world, and he is as it were a box of precious ointment powred forth; but yet for all this, the men of the world are ſo ſtuffed with the ſtinking ſavours of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſts, which ſeem more delightſome unto them; as that they cannot ſmell any ſpirituall ſweetneſſe in Chriſt at all: ſo that when the Saints are exceedingly moved and taken with the ſweet ſavours of Chriſt, yet others are nothing taken with thoſe ſpirituall ſavours and that becauſe they ſavour not the things of God. Then the Saints only are perfumed with <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that their hearts for love of him doe deſpiſe unclean luſts and carnall pleaſures, aſpiring unto the heavens in their ſoules, where Chriſt is, who is their happineſſe, their joy, and their treaſure, whom they fix, as it were, a bundle of ſweet <hi>myrrhe</hi> between their breaſts, and doe ſmel a ſweet ſavour in his redemption
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118024:117"/>
and mediation, even as a <hi>cluſter of camphire in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards of Engedi.</hi> Thus much for the commendations of the Spouſe concerning her Beloved.</p>

And therefore the Lord to cheer, and to comfort her in the aſſurance thereof, doth pronounce her excellent beauty, which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uttered with any words, and therefore hee doth preface his ſpeech with a note of attention, ſaying,</p>

                     <p>To <hi>behold,</hi> in it's proper ſignification, is to looke on a thing with our fleſhly eys; but it is uſed to ſignifie a due conſideration, or a due regard of a thing; as, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore the beautifulneſſe and ſeverity of God,</hi> Rom. 11. 12.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the word is taken by way of deriſion, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. where God ſaith concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>the man is become as one of us:</hi> but this is leaſt of all meant in this place.</p>
                     <p>Again, the word <hi>behold</hi> is taken by way of aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:118024:118"/>
to aſſure us of the truth of a thing. And thus it is uſed here; for the Church being ſenſible of her black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deformity in Verſ. 5. Chriſt comforteth her againſt that deformity which ſhee ſaw in her ſelfe, by telling her that ſhee was the <hi>faireſt among women,</hi> Ver. 8. but now to aſſure her of the truth and certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he doth preface his commendations with this word of aſſeveration, ſaying, <hi>Behold thou art faire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Behold</hi> is prefixed to ſuch phraſes, by which the Lord would raiſe up our thoughts to the higheſt pitch of attention and admiration, to quicken us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our dull and miſgiving hearts. The Saints ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times thinke worſe of themſelves, then happily Chriſt would have them, and they are hardly drawne to believe that Chriſt hath made them ſo glorious and ſo happy, as he hath done: now that Chriſt might raiſe the hearts of his people againſt ſuch miſgiving thoughts, he doth rouze and ſtir them up by this note of attention, <hi>Behold, thou art faire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So this word of attention, <hi>Behold,</hi> notes unto us three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> how backward and ſlow of heart we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the things of-Chriſt, &amp; how dull we are at the beſt; ſo that we alwayes ſtand in need of being quickned and rouzed up by ſuch a word of attention as this, <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c. Hence it is that the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy to ſtir up the gift of God that was in him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. where the word <hi>ſtir up</hi> ſignifieth to <hi>ſtir up fire,</hi> or to give <hi>life</hi> to fire; as fire burneth under aſhes, and is revived, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled <note place="margin">

This notes unto us, that the gift of God is as it were a certaine flame kindled in our hearts; but our natures are as the aſhes which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cover and choak this fire in us, and the fleſh, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118024:119"/>
the Devill goe about to put it out, and therefore we on the contrary ſhould labour as much as in us lies, to cheriſh and keep it burning. In this metaphor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeemeth to allude to the type of the Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, who were to cheriſh the holy fire on the Altar, that it might not goe forth: thus our faith and other graces muſt be blowne and ſtirred up: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may have the graces of Chriſt in reſpect of the habits of them, yet we ſhould ſtir them up unto their acts, elſe they may lye dead in us, as fire covered with the aſhes. Chriſt would raiſe our hearts from earthly things unto thoſe that are heavenly, from worldly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto that which is divine, and from carnall joy unto ſpirituall delight. Chriſt had told the Church before that ſhee was beautifull, but leaſt her dull and miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart ſhould not believe it, he adds, <hi>Behold, thou art faire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a note of wonder and admiration, as <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall be with Child.</hi> What greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can there be, then for a Virgin to conceive and bring forth a Son? So here, <hi>Behold thou art faire:</hi> this muſt needs be a wonderfull thing that ſhee that was black and deformed, ſhould be thus beautifull and fair, and that her naturall deformity ſhould be cover'd with a ſupernaturall comelineſſe; this is an admirable thing indeed, and well may it be prefaced with a note of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Behold thou art faire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it importeth to us an aſſurance of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall beauty: for this word <hi>Behold</hi> is a note of aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I ſaid before, to aſſure us of the truth of the thing. Our hearts are apt to miſgive us, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to believe the bounty and goodneſſe of Chriſt; we can hardly thinke he will beſtow ſuch glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118024:119"/>
upon us as he hath promiſed: now that he may take us off from this unbeliefe, he doth declare it to us by this aſſeveration, <hi>Behold thou art faire,</hi> &amp;c. Thus much for the word of attention, admiration, and aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration: the next thing in the Preface followeth, which is his love title unto his Spouſe.</p>

                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>My love.</head>
                     <p>The ſame word is uſed here, as was in Verſ. 9. and it ſignifieth a <hi>familiar,</hi> a <hi>fellow-friend,</hi> a <hi>companion:</hi> it hath its name of feeding and converſing together. And thus Chriſt declareth the reaſon of that intercourſe of love betweene him and his people, ſaying, <hi>I have called you friends</hi> (not Servants) <hi>for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made knowne unto you:</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>you are my friends if you doe whatſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15. 15. Now in that Chriſt doth ſo often give unto his Spouſe, this ſweet and lovely title of <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and the like: it manifeſts unto us his ſweet, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, undying affection unto his Saints, by which he is one and the ſame to his Church for ever.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts love unto his Saints is an everlaſting and an undying love.</hi> Chriſts love is eternall and everlaſting: a love that never decayes or waxeth cold, like the ſtone <note place="margin">Jul. Solin. <hi>in Polyhiſt.</hi> cap. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Albeſtos,</hi> of which <hi>Solinus</hi> writes of, that being once hot, it can never be cooled againe. The love of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Saints is like a Fountaine ever flowing, and never dried up, or like the ſacred fire which never went out. The love of Chriſt (whoſe gifts and calling are without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.) is an undying affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that never will decay. Hence ſaith he in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118024:120"/>
place, <hi>With everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</hi> Though the Saints offend Chriſt often, yet he loves them ſtill, he onely purges them and heales them of their ſpirituall maladies, which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſmart; but he doth not a whit leſſen or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his love from them. Though his people come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him every day for new ſupplies, yet his goodneſſe is never wearied or tired out; yea, though thouſands, millions of his Saints preſſe upon him at once, yet he hath for them all, and the Fountaine of his love and grace is never emptied. O what a whetſtone ſhould this be to our Spirits? and how ſhould this flame of Chriſt's eternall love towards us kindle a fire of love in our hearts towards him againe? Nothing doth more concilliate and attract love, then love it ſelfe: it would be horrible ingratefull in us, not to ſpend and be ſpent for him that hath lov'd us ſo much as Chriſt hath done; certainly if love doe not draw us unto him nothing will. The acts of Chriſt's love are the cords where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he draws ſouls unto himſelfe, <hi>I drew them with cords of love,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 4. And <hi>I drew them with loving-kindneſſe,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. Nothing will draw us unto Chriſt effectually, if love will not. Thus much for the Preface, the Propoſition followeth.</p>

                     <p>The doubling of the word increaſeth the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118024:120"/>
it expreſſeth the ſuperlative degree, it is an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Hebraiſme to expreſſe that which doth excell by the doubling of the word, as <hi>faire, faire,</hi> that is, moſt excellent and very faire, for it doth expreſſe the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the mind, when the Speech is ſo doubled. Sometime we uſe the ſame forme of Speech even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves, when we would moſt of all villifie one, we ſay, he is naught, he is naught, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the buyer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 14. In like manner, when we would expreſſe ſomething moſt rare and exellent, we uſe to ſay, it is excellent, it is excellent. Even thus the Lord Jeſus commendeth the beauty of his Church to be moſt rare, excellent, and tranſcendent, that which can hardly be uttered with any words. And thus Chriſt praiſeth the excelling beauty of his Church, not onely to comfort her with all the members thereof, that neither the whole, nor the parts of the whole, ſhould be diſcouraged with their blackneſſe and deformity, but alſo to declare thereby, that ſhee is not onely faire but excellent, tranſcendent, and wonderfull faire and glorious in his ſight.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints excell in beauty and are moſt amiable in Chriſt's ſight.</hi> It muſt needs be ſo, for Chriſt is <hi>made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of God, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption. Wiſdome</hi> for covering their ignorance, <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> for bearing their iniquity, <hi>Sanctification</hi> for making them holy, <hi>Redemption</hi> for her full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Salvation. Although the Church be black, and there be many deformities and ſpots in the Saints, while they are here, yet Chriſt beholdeth his people according to thoſe comely graces and vertues of <hi>faith, love, hope, patience,</hi> and the like, wherewith he himſelfe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118024:121"/>
hath decked them: and he doth not ſo much regard their ſpots and deformities, becauſe he hath by his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and cleanſing, <hi>waſhed them all away, and made his Church glorious to himſelfe, not having ſpot or wrincle,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 26, 27. He will cleanſe us, <hi>by the waſhing of water, by the word:</hi> it is a promiſe of free juſtification and ſanctification by faith in Chriſt. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>That the blood of Chriſt waſheth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. That is, from the guilt of all ſin, and alſo from the filth and ſtaine of ſin. And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. he hath <hi>purified unto himſelfe a peculiar people.</hi> That is, he hath ſeparated and conſecrated a people holy for himſelfe, <hi>zealous of good works.</hi> And Chriſt's blood <hi>purgeth our Conſciences,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. Now in that Chriſt hath waſhed and purged his Church, he hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the greateſt love and liking unto her; according to this we have an expreſſion in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he hath loved us, and waſhed us in his blood.</hi> The greateſt demonſtration of his love was, in that he ſhed his blood for us for the cleanſing of us from our ſins. Thus the Church is made faire and beautifull in the ſight of Chriſt, even by the waſhings of his blood.</p>
                     <p>Againe, ſhee is beautifull in reſpect of all thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Chriſt hath endowed her withall, as <hi>faith, love, hope, patience,</hi> and the like. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 7. the Prophet mentioneth the <hi>beauty of wiſdome.</hi> And when the Church ſhall obey Chriſts voice, and forſake her owne naturall corruptions, it is ſaid, he taketh delight in her beauty. <hi>Hearken O Daughter, and conſider, and incline thine eare: forget alſo thine owne people, and thy Fathers houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>The eyes of the Saints may be referred to theſe three ſorts: they be <hi>Corporall, Mentall,</hi> or <hi>Perſonall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The corporall or bodily eyes be externall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeated in the head (as the windows of nature) having lids for drawing up, or letting downe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the inward ſenſe inſtincteth. Unbridled eyes are ſaid to be <hi>full of adultery,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14. And <hi>eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſtrange women,</hi> Prov. 23. 33. The eye is an inlet to filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe: hence it is <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, he had <hi>made a Covenant with his eyes,</hi> Job 31. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For mentall eyes, they be the inward ſenſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Imagination, Phantaſie, Conceit,</hi> &amp;c. all theſe have their ſeat chiefly in the head, commanding all the externall ſenſes as they pleaſe. All which ſenſes are comprehended in the word <hi>Minde:</hi> now as for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man he mindeth earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. And therefore the Apoſtle enjoyneth the Saints to be <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Spirit of their mind,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 23. and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Creation that is in <hi>righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> The mind is the eye of the ſoule, ſo that he meanes not a bodily change, but a change, but a change of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul, and that of the higheſt faculty, namely,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118024:122"/>
the underſtanding and reaſon, By which alſo the Spirit of God doth work upon all the inferiour faculties.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For perſonall eyes, they be ſuch as be imputed to be ſuch in reſpect of their Office and place: and ſuch are the Miniſters of Chriſt, thoſe that have received ſome excellent gifts from the Lord: as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. 17. <hi>If the whole body were an eye</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>where were the hearing?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks this, leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould be diſcontented at the meanneſſe of their gifts in compariſon of others, and alſo ſheweth them, that if it were ſo as they deſired, to wit, that all ſhould be quall one to another in the gifts of the Spirit, there would be a deſtruction of the whole body: for it could not be a body unleſſe it were made of many Members knit together, and diverſe one from another. Now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates they ſhould be eyes to the Common-wealth: and for ſuch as the Lord hath cloathed with his Spirit for to adminiſter the word of truth, ſuch are as eyes to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now I might come to examine what Doves be, to whom theſe eyes are reſembled: they are Birds well knowne amongſt us, and therefore need no perſonall deſcription. A Bird of a right ſimple carriage, and a feeder of the beſt graine, whoſe Song is mourning, very fruitfull, and one that conſtantly returneth to her own home, and very faithfull unto her mate.</p>
                     <p>Now here Chriſt commendeth the Church for her eyes, becauſe if they be faire, they doe eaſily cover the ſpots and deformities of the reſt of the members of the body. He ſeteth forth the ſimplicity, ſincerity, humility, meekneſſe, but eſpecially the ſpirituall chaſtity of the Church, ſetting forth not only her inward affection, but alſo her outward appearance, ſo that the Church hath
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:118024:122"/>
no unchaſt looks or countenances (of which we read ſomewhat in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17, 18. 20.) but contenteth her ſelfe with Chriſt her only Husband, and even as the Dove, when ſhe hath choſen a match, ſhee keepeth her ſelfe unto him only, and looketh not upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according as the Philoſophers write and affirme of them.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the ſpirituall chaſtity of the Saints is very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and pleaſing thing in the eyes of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord doth not onely commend the beauty of his Church, but alſo praiſeth her ſpirituall chaſtity, for indeed her ſpirituall chaſtity is a great part of her ſpirituall beauty. The chaſtity of Virgins is much to be commended, and a thing requiſite for all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to poſſeſſe their veſſell in holineſſe. Thus alſo is the ſpirituall chaſtity of the Church very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and comely, when the Church can be ſaid to be a chaſt and pure virgin given up unto Chriſt. Now as there is the filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe of the fleſh; ſo there is a ſpirituall whoredome often complained of, and condemned in Scripture: Then as in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the Bride-groome doth much delight in the chaſtity and ſimplicity of his Bride: ſo the faithfull ſoule, being married unto Chriſt, there is chaſtity required, a thing delightfull in the eyes of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Church of Chriſt then muſt not looke after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or commit ſpirituall whoredome with any; but ſhee muſt keep her faith, hope, love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction wholly and entirely towards him alone.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe tends that of the Prophet, when he propheſies of a remnant that ſhould forſake idolatry, he ſaith: <hi>At that day ſhall a man looke to his maker, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118024:123"/>
his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the holy one of Iſrael: and he ſhal not looke to the Altars, the work of mens hands, neither ſhall reſpect that which his fingers have made, either the groves or the images,</hi> Iſa. 17. 7, 8. In that he nameth <hi>groves &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> he hath reſpect to the diverſe ſorts of places which they had to worſhip their Idols: their groves and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy places were ſuch as they uſed in the heate of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and their ſunne-images, ſet in ſun-ſhiny places, which they made uſe of in colder weather: by theſe two therefore, are all ſorts of Idols and idolatrous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices deſigned: but the Prophet tells of a remnant, that ſhould eſcape all theſe, and ſhould look to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one alone.</p>
                     <p>They then that embrace the doctrines and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, worſhipping ſtocks and ſtones, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit abominable whoredome, according as the word of God chargeth them. Such as imbrace this world, be called <hi>adulterers and adultereſſes,</hi> Jam. 4. 4. And <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe which is idolatry,</hi> Col. 3. 5. And ſuch as did forſake the Lord, <hi>their eyes went after their idols,</hi> Ezek. 20. 24. And ſuch are called <hi>eyes, beholding ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> Prov. 23. 33. Thoſe then that will be faithfull unto the Lord, and be beautifull in his ſight, muſt have doves eyes: they muſt with a ſingle eye of faith looke upon Jeſus Chriſt, and love him, and ſtay upon him alone, and not upon the world, or upon riches, honours, pleaſures, or any worldly contentment whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>The corporall eye muſt be like the Dove for ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and chaſtity: this eye (as our Saviour teacheth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) <hi>is the light of the body:</hi> and without the eye there is nothing but darknes in the bodie: it is the window of the bodie, which if it be not carefully
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118024:123"/>
watched, will be a great inlet of evill. The mentall eye, which is the eye of the ſoule, muſt alſo aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Dove in all ſimplicity: and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt the mind be ſimple, chaſt, innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the light of the ſoule, and it ſitteth at the ſoules helme, ſteering all the outward ſenſes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it's ſelfe pleaſeth. And for thoſe that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall eyes, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they ſhould prepare the Church for one Husband, even to preſent it as a pure Virgin unto Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the eye of the ſoule is the light of the ſoule, and that is faith; the delight then that Chriſt taketh in his Saints, is the beauty of this eye of faith; and this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall never decay, but wax more and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So much for the commendations given by Chriſt: now followeth the like praiſe which his church returneth to him again.</p>

Now all theſe things were fulfilled and compleated in Chriſt, who by his heavenly Doctrines, and words of grace and conſolation to his people, doth become ſweet as the <hi>honey comb</hi> unto them, and very pleaſant, All Chriſt's adminiſtrations of the covenant of grace are his ſtaves of beauty and pleaſantneſſe.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſt is the fountain of all that ſpirituall beauty of the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As Chriſt had commended her graces, ſo ſhee prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him for the cauſe of thoſe graces. For it is cleare, that the Church hath all her beauty &amp; ornaments from him, it is he that waſheth her, and makes her glorious, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. It is moſt true, that the beauty and glory of the heavenly new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is exceeding great, as it is ſet forth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. Yet the glory of the Bridegroom Jeſus Chriſt far exceeds in beauty, even as much as the Ocean doth the leſſer ſtreams, for he is the fountaine of all glory and beauty. Hence it is, the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth this praiſe unto him; for he indeed is fair and comely. Who can ſet forth the glory of Chriſt? who can deſcribe his beauty and comelineſſe? Not the carnall men of the world, in whoſe account Chriſt <hi>had no forme or comelineſſe upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 3. And in reſpect of his depreſſed condition in the world, and by reaſon of his deep ſufferings, <hi>his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was marred more then any man, and his forme more then the ſonnes of men,</hi> Iſa. 52. 14. Therefore <hi>hee was rejected of men,</hi> Iſa. 53. 3. Hee was ſcarce deemed worthy the name of a man; hee had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or eſtimation in the eys of the men of the world: theſe ſee not his beauty, and therefore praiſe him
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:118024:125"/>
not: but the Saints doe glory in Chriſt's beauty and comelineſſe, becauſe they ſee him to be the fountaine of glory and praiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Church doth not ſo much glory in her owne beauty, as ſhee doth in the glory of Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>The Saints doe indeed glory in their owne beauty; but yet ſo, as they know they have all from Chriſt, and ſo indeed they glory onely in him, according to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 31. <hi>If any man glory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt is exceeding delectable and well-pleaſing unto his Church, in all his adminiſtrations of grace unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt's words are full of grace, and therefore <hi>ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the honey-comb:</hi> the performance of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is beautifull and pleaſant. And indeed Chriſt is the very ſpring or fountain of pleaſantneſſe and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for there is in him a greater meaſure of beauty then is powred upon the Church, as appeareth by the Churches adding another Epithite of love, ſaying,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118024:125"/>
                        <hi>yea, pleaſant,</hi> an expreſſion far beyond the former. And this falleth out, becauſe he hath received the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure, we in meaſure; hee had the Spirit as a fountaine, we as the ſtreams: hee had all glory and beauty as the ſun; we receive of his divine beams, as the bright rayes of his glory darted down upon us. Thus much for the Spouſes commendations of her beloved, either of them having praiſed each other in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſpeeches; in the next place they do both joyntly rejoyce and glory together.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Saints become flouriſhing and fruitfull by the communion they have with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is the Apoſtle prays that the <hi>Collosſians</hi> might <hi>be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in every good worke, and increaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> Unto this are all the Saints exhorted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that yee may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſpirituall growth of the whole body of Chriſt, and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, who were to beare an earneſt affection to the truth, whereby they might grow in Chriſt, for he quickneth and cheriſheth his Church, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of diverſe Members, and gives unto each of them a ſuitable meaſure and proportion; and by <hi>this effectuall working in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the ediſying of it ſelfe in love,</hi> ver. 16. Now we muſt know, that this ſpirituall growth doth not flow from any principle of nature, but it is Chriſt thet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth vigour and ſtrength above nature. For which obſerve the phraſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 14. ſpeaking of the righteous, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall bring forth fruit in old age:</hi> In the Originall it is, in <hi>grayneſſe,</hi> or <hi>hary age.</hi> Now in old age, when naturall ſtrength is decayed, none can be <note place="margin">

                        </note> fruitfull without a ſupernaturall ſupply of ſtrength and vigour. Hence it is, that <hi>David</hi> prayeth unto the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Caſt me not off in the time of old age, forſake
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118024:127"/>
me not when my ſtrength faileth, now alſo when I am old and gray-headed, O God forſake me not, untill I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this Generation, &amp; thy power to every one that is to come,</hi> Pſal. 71. 9. 18. It is ſaid of <hi>Sara,</hi> that ſhee <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived strength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a child, when ſhee was paſt age: And he</hi> (to wit Abraham) <hi>as good as dead, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11. 11, 12. So are the Saints, as it were, paſt age, and dead by nature, therefore they muſt (as <hi>Sara)</hi> receive ſtrength from Chriſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we underſtand the words of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all increaſe of the Saints, begotten unto Chriſt by the ſeed of the word: Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That multitudes of Children are borne unto Chriſt, which are begotten by the immortall ſeed of the word.</hi> For by this phraſe <hi>Our bed is greene,</hi> noteth unto us the fertility of Children (to wit of Sons and Daughters) ariſing from the womb of the Church, eſpecially of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The Evangelicall Prophet ſeing this, it cauſed him to cry out in this wiſe. <hi>The deſolate hath more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then the married wife.</hi> And becauſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that ſhould come in and imbrace Chriſt, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Enlarge the place of thy Tents, and let them ſtretch forth the Curtaines of thy habitations,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 54. 1, 2. The Prophet ſpeaks as if ſo many ſhould come in to Chriſt, that ſhe ſhould ſeeme to want roome to receive them; and therefore bids her <hi>ſtretch forth her curtaines,</hi> alluding to the Tents in which they dwelt. And in Chap. 66. 8. he crieth out by way of admiration, <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? ſhall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day? or ſhall a Nation be borne at once? for as ſoone as Zion travailed, ſhee brought forth her children.</hi> By
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:118024:128"/>
this the Prophet doth intimate the multitudes of thoſe that ſhould ſuddenly be borne a new, and begotten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt by the publication of the Goſpell, which was figured out by thoſe multitudes that returned on a ſuddaine from <hi>Babylon,</hi> as if a whole Nation had been borne in one day. This was the promiſe that the Lord made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it is not to be limited to his Children after the fleſh, but to his Children of the promiſe, that his ſeed ſhould be as the <hi>ſtarrs,</hi> and as the <hi>duſt</hi> for multitude, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 14. And at the firſt promulgation of the Goſpell, there were <hi>daily added unto the Church,</hi> Acts 2. 47. And <hi>the Saviour of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was manifeſt in every place,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 14. Hence it was that Beleivers after Chriſts aſcention were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The multitude of them that believed.</hi> And it was Prophecyed that <hi>Ten men ſhall take hold out of all Languages of the Nations, of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſaying, we will goe with you, for we have heard that God is with you,</hi> Zech. 8. 20. 23. That is, many of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould imbrace the truth, which in former times were reſtrained within the Nation of the Jewes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophecy in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9. 27. where it is ſaid, <hi>God ſhall inlarge Japhet, and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem,</hi> &amp;c. But we muſt not make <hi>univerſality</hi> the note of the Saints, for <hi>univerſality</hi> is common to Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Idolatours. The whore was to <hi>ſet upon many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which were <hi>peoples, and multitudes, and Nations, and tongues: and the Kings of the earth</hi> were to be <hi>made drunk with the wine of her fornications, and all the Nations to drinke thereof,</hi> Revel. 17. 15. 18. 3. Therefore we muſt underſtand the Church of Chriſt to be numerous in her ſelfe, and not comparatively, ſetting her with the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118024:128"/>
world; but to be many comparatively with the old Church of the Jewes, for <hi>more are the children of the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late then of the married wife,</hi> Iſa. 54. 1.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, this ſpirituall birth is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes both Chriſt and his Church; for the union of Chriſt and his Church is the cauſe of ſuch an everlaſting greenneſſe and fruitfullneſſe. Chriſt is as the <hi>Agent,</hi> and the Church in her ſenſes and affections is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: Chriſt ſoweth the ſeed of his word, and the Church as the ground receiveth the ſeed, that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them are many ſpirituall Sons and daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten unto God. Hence they doe mutually and jointly rejoyce and ſing at the Churches inlargement. It is not ſaid <hi>My bed,</hi> but <hi>our bed,</hi> thereby ſhewing that it concernes them both. The heavenly procreation of many ſpirituall Sons and daughters, and the freſh and flouriſhing ſpringing of thoſe goodly plants which are thus borne of the Spirit of God, is matter of joy and rejoycing both to Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the place of conception, now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place of ſpirituall education.</p>

                     <p>The beams of this ſpirituall houſe are ſet forth by the matter they were of, they were of <hi>Cedar: Cedar</hi> is a Tree very common in Mount <hi>Lebanon;</hi> and (as ſome ſay) like unto <hi>Juniper,</hi> or rather to <hi>Cypres</hi> for leafe;

but for the Tree it ſelfe, it is tall, and ſtrong, and the wood of permament nature, and of a very ſweet ſmell, and it rotteth not, nor admitting any worme.

                     <p>Theſe Cedars and Brutine trees, may both be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the perſons of the Saints; and alſo unto the doctrine of faith, wherewith the Curch is built upon Chriſt the chief corner Stone, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No man can lay any other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then that which is laid, which is Christ: Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any man build upon this foundation, Gold, Silver, precious ſtones,</hi> &amp;c.

Now all theſe ſimilitudes doe ſet forth thoſe holy perſons and graces wherewith the Church ſhould be adorned: all thoſe things, ſignified by the houſes of Cedar, and by the Galleries of fir, are ſtrong and firme and very redolent and ſavory, unto the comfort of the Saints, and the glory of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In the Verſe before Chriſt and his Church ſung the prayſe of their Bed, here they ſing the praiſe of their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>That the Saints are Chriſts houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are called, <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 17. and the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. Heaven is his houſe, where he manifeſteth his glory, and the world is his houſe,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:118024:130"/>
where he manifeſteth his power and wiſdome; but the Saints are his houſe, where he manifeſteth his eſpeciall grace and favour. The Lord <hi>dwells with the humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. That is, he is preſent with them, to cheare and comfort them with his grace and ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Now the Lord maketh uſe of the Saints as men doe of their houſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Men uſe to abide and be reſident in their houſes; a houſe is a place of reſidence. So Chriſt is alway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Saints, by his Spirit unto the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>And lo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am with you unto the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Men doe refreſh themſelves by eating, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like, in houſes: thus Chriſt is ſaid to feaſt and ſup with his Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Chriſt doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe familiarly, chearfully, and comfortably with them, as friends uſe to Feaſt and make merry one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Men doe take great delight and contentment in their houſes, as being a part of their worldly excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: So Chriſt taketh great contentment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Saints: <hi>The upright are his delight,</hi> Prov. 11. 20.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Men lay up their greateſt treaſures and their moſt precious Jewells in their houſes: So doth Chriſt, he comes into the ſoule (his houſe) to beſtow his Jewels, and to ſpread his treaſures of grace there; he makes <hi>the ſpirit of glory to reſt upon his Saints,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14.</p>
                     <p>Now as the glory of Chriſts houſe is ſet forth, ſo alſo is the glory of the <hi>beams or rafters</hi> thereof commended unto us. You heard that theſe beams were applied to the perſons of the Saints, wherewithall the houſe of Chriſt is builded. Chriſt is the Foundation, and the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118024:131"/>
Saints are the ſuper-ſtructure put into the building. This is that the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>To whom comming</hi> (that is unto Chriſt) <hi>as unto a living ſtone: yee alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as lively ſtones are built up as ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſt-hod, to offer up ſpirituall Sacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So Gods houſe is built of Saints, of lively ſtones, ſuch as have received life from him, &amp; this houſe is Gods dwelling place, where he communicates both grace and glory. And it is called a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> houſe, becauſe it is built up by the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Now as Chriſts houſe is commended by the <hi>beams</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo the <hi>beams</hi> or <hi>rafters,</hi> are ſet forth by the matter they are of and that is <hi>Cedar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints (who are the materialls of Chriſts houſe) in reſpect of their excellency, are called Cedars. Cedar</hi> was uſed in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 36. and did prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the Saints under the Goſpell Church. And the Saints are compared to <hi>Cedars. Pſal.</hi> 92. 13. Now the Saints may well be compared to Cedars, in diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but eſpecially in theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Cedar</hi> is a very tall and high tree, all other trees are but ſhrubs unto them. So are the Saints, in their gifts, in their graces, in their priviledges and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; they are above the men of the world, and therefore they are taller then the people by the head and ſhoulders, as it was ſaid of King <hi>Saul. Solomon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this and ſaith, <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his Neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12. 26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cedar</hi> is a tree of incomparable ſtrength: So the Saints are made ſtronger then their enemies; they are ſo ſtrong that they are become <hi>more then Conquerours,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:118024:131"/>
through him that loved them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cedar</hi> is a very durable wood: So the Saints are ſuch as endure to the end; they ſtand faſt in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and are not moved away from the hope that is in them. Though they walke in the midſt of temptations, yet they never give over their hope: <hi>Though thou kill me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) yet will I truſt in thee.</hi> And though the Saints <hi>walk in darkneſſe and have no light at all, yet they will truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay themſelves upon their God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Cedar</hi> rotteth not; no more doe the Saints decay in their graces. Indeed there may be ſome ſpirituall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guour or deadnes befall them, by reaſon of ſome deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or temptation, and the like: but for the graces of the Spirit in them, they never periſh nor decay.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Cedar</hi> (as ſome report) will not admit of any worme; no more will the Saints admit of any worm of coveteouſneſſe, or any worldly thing to conſume them, or eat them out.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Cedar is very ſweet of ſmell; So the Saints are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous and redolent of ſavour, in all their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to God by Jeſus Chriſt: and to man in their lives and converſations.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Cedar</hi> (as ſome ſay) will putrifie and kill things that are living and reſtore and conſerve that which is rotten: So the Saints have received power and grace from Chriſt to kill and mortifie all their luſts, and have alſo received power from him to live and revive, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though dead before. This Chriſt himſelfe tells us, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Son of God, and they ſhall live.</hi>

whither Chriſt or his Church uttered theſe words: hence it is thought of ſome to be the ſpeech of Chriſt: Of others, to be ſpoken by the Church: It is moſt true, that Chriſt and his Church are both of them ſweet, fair, comely, and beautifull; yea, ſo exceeding ſweet and beautifull, that all the ſweeteſt Roſes, and whiteſt lilies in the world, are not comparable unto them. If Chriſt be called the <hi>Roſe</hi> and the <hi>Lilie,</hi> it is moſt true, he is ſo, in reſpect of the excellency of his graces in himſelfe, which he doth moſt freely communicate with his Saints. And if the Church be compared unto them; it is a very fit compariſon, whereby her graces received from Chriſt may be ſhewn forth, wherein ſhe is moſt lovely and pleaſant, for ſweet odour and beauty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that promiſe made in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. 7. <hi>I will be as the dew upon Iſrael, and he ſhall grow as the lilie: and they ſhall revive as the Corne, and grow as the Vine, the ſent thereof ſhall be as the Wine of Lebanon.</hi> He means that the knowledge of him and his doctrine, and the receiving of his graces ſhall be very pleaſing and delightfull unto his people, like unto excellent wine.</p>
                     <p>But I take theſe to be the words of the Bridegroome commending himſelfe for his moſt excellent ſweet ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, teſtified to all, but eſpecially to his Church by communicating his grace and ſpirit unto her. The Church doth not ſpeake this of her ſelfe, for then ſhe ſhould commend her ſelfe, which is not meet.

relating to himſelfe as a meer man, ſaith, <hi>That his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not true if he beare witneſſe of himſelfe;</hi> John 5. 31. But yet in another place relating to himſelfe as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as God and man in one perſon, and one with the father, he ſpake cleane contrary to this: <hi>Though I doe beare record of my ſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet my record is true,</hi> John 8. 14. So that the Saints may not commend themſelves, although it be true, they did ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſomething of their owne vertues, but it was for holy example and inſtructions ſake, and it was ſtill with reference unto the maine object of praiſe, which was Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Saints may commend themſelves.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. When the praiſe thereof is given unto God.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> (as you know) was conſtrained to praiſe himſelfe, leaſt his doctrine ſhould be defaced, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17.

                     </p>
                     <p>Put for Chriſt to praiſe himſelfe, it is without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very good and lawfull: for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt doth never commend himſelfe above his worth and excellency; neither did he commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe above that which was meet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt was God, and therefore could not ſin: and as he was man he was holy, harmeleſſe, and ſeparate from ſinners; there was never any ſin found in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</p>

3. As Mediatour he was filled with the holy Ghoſt beyond all meaſure, and therefore his actions were holy, and all of them infinitely praiſe-worthy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He hath not a greater in the point of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſanctification, and eternall ſalvation, to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of, or to commend, then himſelfe. He indeed is the <hi>Apoſtle of our profeſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Angell or Meſſenger of the Covenant</hi> between God and us, and therefore unto him <hi>give all the Prophets witneſſe,</hi> Act. 10. 43.</p>
                     <p>Now then we may ſee, that as the Bride began the former Song, ſeting forth the excellency of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, and her deſire to be with him, as the Author and Spring of all her joy and happineſſe: ſo here, the Bridegroome beginneth firſt to praiſe himſelfe, and then he commendeth his Spouſe.</p>
                     <p>Now in that Chriſt doth thus praiſe himſelfe: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt may and doth commend and praiſe the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and beauty of his owne graces unto his Saints.</hi> Chriſt doth here commend himſelfe and his Spouſe, both of them being excellent, good, ſweet, faire, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; yea ſo, as they reſemble each the other: for as he is as the lilie, ſhe is ſo likewiſe; but yet Chriſt praiſeth himſelfe in the firſt place, becauſe he is the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſweetneſſe and beauty, all fullneſſe of ſweet things is in him, and from him the Church receiveth all her goodneſſe, beauty, and ſweetneſſe. It doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that Chriſt may and did praiſe himſelfe for his owne vertue and graces, by thoſe ſelfe predications of his which we find in the Scriptures. <hi>Looke unto me and be yee ſaved all the ends of the Earth. Come unto me all yee that labour and are heavy laden.</hi> When he read that place of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 61. 1. &amp;c. He told the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:118024:135"/>
people, this day is this Scripture fullfilled in your ears. When the excommunicated man aſked him who the Son of God was, he anſwered him, <hi>Thou haſt both ſeene him, and it is he that talketh with thee:</hi> and he told the Samaritaneſſe plainly, that he was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And it is ſaid of the two Diſciples, <hi>That beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he Expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelfe.</hi> Now all this doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto us the excellency of Chriſt's graces, that he might praiſe and commend himſelfe without the leaſt blot of arrogancy, or taking too much upon himſelfe. Thus Chriſt might doe, being the very Fountaine and Spring of all ſpirituall ſweetneſſe and beauty. Thus much for Chriſt's commending himſelfe, next we have the commendation it ſelfe.</p>

Now unto the roſe growing in this paſture, Chriſt aſſimilates himſelfe. Now let us take notice, that in diverſe reſpects Chriſt may be likened unto a roſe, which may ſerve as ſo many Obſervations. Chriſt may be reſembled to a roſe in ſuch reſpects as theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The roſe is pleaſant to the eye for the red &amp; orient colour of it: ſo is Chriſt, he is ſaid to be <hi>white and ruddy, the chiefe of ten thouſand,</hi> Song 5. 10. White and red meeting in a roſe, it is (as I may ſay) the beauty of beauties, and ſuch is the beauty of Jeſus Chriſt. The red colour of Chriſt may ſignifie his bloody ſufferings: <note place="margin">

He is glorious in apparrell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherefore art thou red in apparrell, and thy Garments like him that treadeth in the winepreſſe? I have trodden the winepreſſe alone,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 63. 1. 2, Chriſt was ſtained with his owne blood. He is alſo white in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, his righteouſneſſe is deſcribed by <hi>white linnen,</hi> Revel. 19. 8. Now this temperament and mingling of white and red after ſuch a myſticall way in Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the ſurpaſſing beauty of Chriſt, making him more glorious then any in the World. No marvaile then though the Pſalmiſt ſaith thus of him, <hi>Thou art fairer then the ſonnes of Adam,</hi> Pſal. 45. 2. It is true, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brings in carnall people ſpeaking thus of Chriſt: <hi>Hee hath no forme nor comelineſſe, and when we ſhall ſee him there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 2. But though Chriſt appeare thus to carnall hearts, yet he is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:118024:136"/>
very excellent and deſireable unto the Saints: he is to them red and orient of colour, as the <hi>roſe of ſharon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The roſe is ſweet and comfortable to the ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to refreſh the ſenſes, and ſo the chiefeſt of all Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Such a one is Chriſt, nothing in the world is more pleaſing and delightfull then he is to his Saints: the redolency of his grace doth exceedingly take the ſenſes of their ſouls: his love like odoriferous flowers doth, to their unſpeakable delight, draw and raviſh their minds after him: whereby the ſenſes of their ſoul are exceedingly taken with his ſweetneſſe. Hence it was, that Chriſt was repreſented to us by fragrant <hi>wine,</hi> by odoriferous <hi>Ointment,</hi> and by ſweet <hi>ſpikenard, myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>camphyre,</hi> as in the former Chapter, and here by a ſweet ſmelling <hi>roſe.</hi> This comfort cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>forget the things that were behind him,</hi> &amp; to <hi>count all things dung in compariſon of Chriſt:</hi> ſuch a ſavour it was that did comfort and refreſh the Martyrs ſenſes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: when one of them thought no otherwiſe of the fire, then if he had been lodged in a pleaſant bed of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. When <hi>PolyCarpus</hi> (Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna)</hi> was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in ſtead of ſtench, the Chriſtians are reported to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt.</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 15.</note> have ſmelt a fragrant ſweet odour, as of incenſe, or of ſome precious perfume. Hence it is, that the faith and graces of the Saints are ſo impregnable, and that their hope is ſo indefatigable and never out of breath, that no ſtormes of temptation can breake their ſpirits, and make them give out: it is nothing (I ſay) but that exceeding ſwavity and ſweetneſſe, that they find to be in Chriſt: his ſweetneſſe makes them take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities and reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for his ſake; and when they be weake in themſelves, then they are ſtrong in him,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118024:136"/>
and more then Conquerours, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Chriſt is no leſſe ſweet unto his Father alſo; for by Chriſt all our ſervices are made ſweet and redo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. It was not the ſavour of <hi>Noah's</hi> Beaſts and Birds, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 8. 21.) but the ſavour of Chriſts Sacrifice, which cauſed the heavenly Father to ſmell a ſweet ſavour of reſt with the Earth. It is through Chriſt we find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Father: it is he that is gone into the heavenly Sanctuary (as in the Law the High-prieſt went into the Sanctuary) with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> with the names of his people upon his Breaſt, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall before the Lord continually: ſo that now through his mediation we may draw neere unto God in <hi>Plerophorie,</hi> and full aſſurance of faith: nothing doubting, but that God will for his ſake accept both of our perſons and of our prayers. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. Here is ſweetneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, let us but obſerve the Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> not as though there were ſome that did not ſin; for that this very Apoſtle beats againſt expreſly in the end of the firſt Chapter: but when he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> he ſpeaks cordiall things, he ſpeaks to the heart and comfort of ſinners, ſhewing that with God there is no acceptation of perſons; but all without exception of any exteriour adjuncts and qualitits, doe find grace in Gods ſight through Chriſt: this is plainly the inference of the indefinite particle, <hi>Any.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſaith, that <hi>we have an Advocate;</hi> an Advocate is a a forenſicall word, and it ſignifies properly one that is called to, or aſſumed as an aſſiſtant, as a friend, as an
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:118024:137"/>
helper, as an interceſſor: ſuch a one is Chriſt for his Saints, he is their Patron, he is their ſpokſe-man, he it is that pleadeth their cauſe, he it is that by the merit of his expiation, doth intreat for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt is an <hi>Advocate with the Father:</hi> he is ſo with the Father that he is owne naturall Son; ſo with him that he needs but onely ſhew himſelfe for us, and without ſpeaking any word we are accepted: hence it is that he ſaith, <hi>I will pray the Father for you,</hi> John 16. 26.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Advocate is <hi>Jeſus;</hi> a moſt ſweet and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhing name, and it ſignifies a Saviour; one that, doth not onely intreat for us, but perfectly ſave us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there's an addition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of comfort in this name, it ſignifies anointed. He was anointed to be our Prieſt, to offer a reconciling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt is called the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by way of eminency; none ſo righteous as he, he is perfectly righteous, ſo that he need not plead for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he pleadeth onely for us, and therefore muſt needs have good ſucceſſe in his pleading.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is ſuch a one as ſtands in our roome, and takes the whole penalty and puniſhment due to us for our offence, upon himſelfe: therefore the Apoſtle adds that he is the <hi>propitiation for our ſins:</hi> That is, he is the Sacrifice that begs and procures pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for us. Thus Chriſt gets acceptance for us with the Father, according as he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever you will aske the Father in my name he will give it you,</hi> John 16. 23. It is Chriſt that puts incenſe upon our prayers, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles them with the ſweet odours of his owne merits: he is the onely Altar of Chriſtians, ſanctifying all their gifts and Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:118024:137"/>
3. The roſe delighteth in ſhadowy places: for as over much cold would ſtarve it, ſo overmuch heat would ſcorch and burne it. Thus Chriſt doth appear unto his Saints in a moderate way, in all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he ſometime afflicts his people that he may purge them, and heale them; which cannot be done without ſome ſmart and bitterneſſe, but yet withall he mingles abundance of love and ſweetneſſe with thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that his ſweetneſſe doth (as it were) ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all his bitterneſſe: his bitterneſſe is in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, but his ſweetneſſe in the ſuperltive. Chriſt doth ſo moderate his diſpenſations, that he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us by wantonneſſe to abuſe his love and mercy, neither yet will he ſuffer us to periſh by afflictions.</p>
                     <p>4. The roſe is a cooler unto nature: thus Chriſt is a cooler of his Fathers wrath and indignation. The ſoul being convicted of its ſinfullneſſe, ſpeaks as the Prophet doth, <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with the everlaſting burnings?</hi> God is devouring fire and everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in relation to ſinners: his wrath is like the fire of hell, as I may ſay: the breath of his indignation is like a River of brimſtone, kindling and perpetually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the flames of <hi>Tophet:</hi> What ſhall the poore ſoul doe now? Here is nothing but menaces and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, terrours and amazements, death and deſtruction, and where is the remedy? No where but in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſing through the Wilderneſſe had a Cloud to cover him, and defend him from the Scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun-beams: now what was that Cloud but a type and ſhaddow of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle makes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. he makes there the Cloud, and the Sea, and the Manna, and the water of the Rock, to be all figures and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118024:138"/>
Images of Chriſt. Chriſt is a Sea to waſh, Manna to feed, water to refreſh, and a cloud to hide the ſoul from the hot and burning wrath of God: the fiery beams of that wrath would ſurely ſuffocate and ſtifle us, were it not that Chriſt did interpoſe and ſot betweene to ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubilate and veile our ſouls from it.</p>
                     <p>5. The roſe though it be ſweet and comfortable to the ſmelling, yet 'tis offenſive to the ſenſe of feeling, becauſe it is full of prickles. Thus is Chriſts Goſpell accompanied with the <hi>Croſſe</hi> and Tribulations, his ſelfe ſuffered in his owne perſon, ſo that in reſpect of his depreſſed condition the Prophet ſaith, <hi>His viſage was ſo marred more then any mans, and his forme more then the Sons of men,</hi> Iſa. 52. 14. And againe he ſaith, <hi>He was deſpiſed and rejected of them, a man of ſorrows and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with griefe: he was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 53. 3. 7. His Members alſo muſt ſuffer the ſame things, they muſt <hi>drinke of his Cup, and be Baptized with his Baptiſme if they will be his Diſciples, they muſt take up their croſſe and follow him.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>Roſe of Sharon,</hi> or <hi>the flower of the field.</hi> Now <hi>Sharon</hi> (as was hinted before) was a field of paſture for Bulls and Oxen contiguate to <hi>Baſhan;</hi> it being a field for grazing and feeding of Cattell, muſt not onely be fertile, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo admit ſhaddowing plats for the beſt ſhelter, in the heat of the day: ſo that the roſes of <hi>Sharon</hi> muſt needs be flowers of a ſingular kind. Now we may note two or three things from the place where this roſe grew, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit <hi>in Sharon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Sharon</hi> was an open field where Cattell fed: Bulls and Oxen and unreaſonable Beaſts did graze there. Hence note, theſe roſes then were ſubject to all ſpoyle and lewd trampling under feet: ſo that Chriſt and his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118024:138"/>
Church were both expoſed to perſecution, to be plucked of all that paſſe by the way, and trodden down and eaten of Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly note from the places fertilitie and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whereby the roſe was ſuper-excellent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the danger it was in: that notwithſtanding the danger of this flower, by reaſon of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> beaſts (yea of <hi>Baſhans</hi> Buls) and all thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous things accompanying Chriſt, yet Chriſt is made able to overcome and conquer them all. Let all his enemies fret and puſh their fill: from <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Boz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> with red garments ſtained with blood, yet Chriſt alone ſhall triumph over them; for ſaith he, <hi>Who is this that comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah? wherefore art thou red in apparrell? &amp;c. I have</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>trodden the wine-preſſe alone, and there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger; and trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtaine all my ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Iſa.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Edom</hi> is put by a Synechdoche for all Chriſtsenemies: becauſe among the enemies of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> were none of the leaſt as appears in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 7. and therefore here <hi>Edome</hi> is propounded as a type of all the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies of Chriſt and his Church: now Chriſt threatneth to diſſipate and break them al; he will tread them downe, as grapes in the wine-preſſe: ſo that Chriſt will preſerve both himſelfe and Church from the fury of the Beaſts of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and Buls of <hi>Baſhan:</hi> for he is exalted at the right hand of the Father, and ſhall reigne untill his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:118024:139"/>
Thirdly, he is the <hi>Roſe of the field,</hi> not of the garden. Hence note: That Chriſt is not a roſe ſprung up, and become orient, and ſweet from the induſtry of man, but groweth only by the providence and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God. Chriſt was not brought forth by any humane power, wiſdome, or wit; but hee was the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father, and the power of God, ſo that Chriſt had his being and all his excellency from God but not from man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the flower of the field is not incloſed and made private to a few, as the flower in the garden, but it is common to all that wil gather it: ſo is Chriſt a common Saviour, not of the Jewes only, but of the Gentiles alſo: God hath enlarged his heritage, ſo that the ſonnes of <hi>Iaphet</hi> may dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem.</hi> Chriſt doth not refuſe any that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but all ſorts of people, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> may be accepted. This is elegantly ſet forth by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 19. where God promiſeth to <hi>plant in the wilderneſſe the Cedar, the Sitath tree, the myrtle, the oyle tree, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together.</hi> This was alſo repreſented unto <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>a ſheet knit at foure corners, wherein were all manner of four-footed beaſts of the earth, and wild beaſts, and creeping things, and fouls of the aire.</hi> Act. 10. 12. And the Apoſtle was bid to ariſe, and to ſlay and eate. Now by this he was taught, that not only the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> were admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt's kingdom: but of <hi>every nation</hi> (as himſelfe afterwards expounds it) he that feareth God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35 We read, that the fleece of <hi>Gideon</hi> was firſt wet, and the bean-floor dry; then afterwards the barne-floore was
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:118024:139"/>
wet, and the fleece dry: ſo God gave his law firſt to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not unto the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> then the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which were the wild olives, were ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and the naturall olives were rejected, but he will at length ſave both Jew and Gentile. The Scripture it ſelfe ſpeaks thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 6, 7. God promiſeth, <hi>that he will bring the ſonnes of the stranger</hi> (that is the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) <hi>to his holy mountaine, and make them joyfull in the houſe of prayer, and their burnt-offerings, and their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſhall be accepted upon his Altar: for</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>my houſe ſhall be called an houſe of prayer for all people.</hi> So that Chriſt was an Altar for all nations, where on both Jewes and Gentiles were an offering acceptable to God. And a like place there is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 7. <hi>All the flocks of Kedar ſhall be gathered together unto thee; the Rams of Nebajoth ſhall miniſter unto thee; they ſhall come up with acceptance on mine Altar, and I will glorifie the houſe of my glory.</hi> Here Chriſt is made an Altar, that makes the Gentiles (as I may ſay) a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling favour unto God.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the flower of the garden is only for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the flower of the field is for profit, it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable, and fit for an ingredient inelectuaries to heale diſeaſes. So looke upon Chriſt as upon the moſt gainfull and profitable thing to the ſoule, that can be imagined: nothing more fit and commodious, nothing more enriching then Chriſt is: he is gaine for himſelfe, without relation to any other beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: he is a rich and ineſtimable treaſure to the ſoul. <hi>Wiſdome is better then Rubies;</hi> and all things that may be deſired, are not to be compared to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11. And doubtleſſe Chriſt is the wiſdome there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:118024:140"/>
of: So for <hi>the roſe of Sharon,</hi> it followeth,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>The lilie of the vallies.</head>
                     <p>Here Chriſt doth aſſimilate himſelfe to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Lilie.</hi> The lilie (ſaith <hi>Pliny)</hi> is next in nobility <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plinie Nat. Hict. lib.</hi> 25 <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> unto the roſe. The Scripture ſets it forth to be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and amiable flower, <hi>even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 29. Chriſt doth aſſimilate himſelfe to the precious <hi>lilie or the valleys,</hi> and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>lilie</hi> is a flower of hot quality: ſo that as Chriſt was compared before to a roſe of cold qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, becauſe he cooles his Fathers wrath, and becauſe he cooles the hot diſtempered luſts in the ſoule: ſo here he is compared to a Lillie, which is hot in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he doth warm and revive his people.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Lillie</hi> is of an excellent cleer colour, it was of a ſuper exexcellent beauty, according to the fore-named place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 29. <hi>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe. But behold</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>a greater then Solomon is here,</hi> Matth. 12. 42. compared to the lillie of the valeys, which farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory. Chriſt was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Spirit of God: It was ſaid of him, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> Iſa. 61. 1. And God ſaith, <hi>I will put my Spirit upon him,</hi> Iſa. 42. 1. That is, I will cloath him with my Spirit. Now if the Spirit be his garment, then no creature, nor all the creatures in the world can compare with him in glory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Lilie</hi> is is called of the Hebrews <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> which ſignifies the flower of ſix, becauſe of his ſix leaves, we have the ſame expreſſion in the Title of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118024:140"/>
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. It is dedicated to him that excelleth on <hi>Shoſhannim,</hi> that is, on <hi>ſix ſtringed inſtruments.</hi> The Hebrew word is derived of <hi>Sheſh,</hi> that is, <hi>ſix:</hi> So in ſix dayes God created the world: ſo the creation of the new Heavens, and new earth is agreeable to the former; which ſhall be done by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Lilie</hi> is of golden colour within: ſo is Chriſt full of golden graces, he is a head of gold, <hi>Song.</hi> 5. and he makes his Members ſutable, by iſſuing out of himſelf, golden ſtreames of grace into their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, The higher and the taller the <hi>Lilie's</hi> ſtalke is, the more dependent and hanging downe is the head thereof: thus it was with Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the forme, (or eſſence) of God, or in the nature and condition of God: yet he tooke upon him the ſtate, and condition of a ſervant <hi>He thought it no robbery (or rapine) to be equall with God:</hi> yet he ſuffered himſelfe to be denuded and robb'd of his glorie by ſinfull men; God cals him <hi>the man, that is his fellow, Zech.</hi> 15. 7. and yet he was made a fellow to Theeves and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and though he was full of glorie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, yet he emptyed himſelfe of all; for ſo are the words of the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>he evacuated or emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed himſelfe,</hi> that is, he reduced himſelf as it were to nothing, he did, as it were, exhauſt and draw himſelfe drie, he did for a time deny himſelfe, caſting aſide his robes of Majeſty; by his voluntary condiſcending to ſuch a low debaſement, as he under-went for us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:118024:141"/>
Sixthly, The <hi>Lilie</hi> is a flower of a redolent and ſweet ſavour: ſo Chriſt in all his graces, is much more ſweet and raviſhing.</p>
                     <p>Now for the <hi>valleys,</hi> where theſe Lilies grew, it notes unto us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Chriſt's condition was meane and low, in reſpect of outward things, he is not the lofty <hi>Cedar,</hi> but the lowly Lilly: But though Chriſt was like a Tree, whoſe root was in the earth; yet his fruit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as high as heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Valleyes note unto us the fruit and benefit of Chriſt's humiliation, for the Lilie of the valleyes is capable of more moiſture, then is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the mountains: even ſo Chriſt by debaſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, received abundance of grace and glorie from the Father; and wee alſo are exalted by his debaſement, for by a ſupply of his grace, notwithſtanding our low and baſe eſtate, are made ſweet and amiable like the Lilie; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will be as the dew upon Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, he ſhall bloſsome as the Lilie, and ſtrike forth his roots as Lebanon, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5.</p>
                     <p>So much of Chriſt's ſpeech touching himſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo compared himſelf to <hi>The roſe of Sharon,</hi> and <hi>the Lilie of the valleys.</hi> Now followeth his ſpeech touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Church.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Now Chriſt utters the commendations of his ſpouſe, where he confirmeth and amplyfieth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpeech, preferring her above other people, as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:118024:141"/>
the Lilie is above Thornes and Thiſtles; and withall ſiignifying how ſhe is afflicted and pricked with them, as with Thorns.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe we have Chriſts compariſon betweene the Church, and ſuch a Lilie, as growes among Thornes.</p>
                  <p>Now let us conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What</hi> and <hi>who</hi> is this <hi>Lili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Thorne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly the <hi>Daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, what this Lilie is; it may neceſſarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of the Church; notwithſtanding Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was compared unto the Lilie in the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>It is not unuſuall in Scripture for Chriſt, and his Church to be ſet forth, by one and the ſame thing: Chriſt is called <hi>the light, Joh.</hi> 1. 7, 8. his Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſame, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 14. So in the former verſe, Chriſt is termed a <hi>Lilie,</hi> which for a new conſideration the ſame terme is given unto the Church, and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reſpect of ſpirituall beauty, the Church is compared to a <hi>Lilie</hi> that is white of colour, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautifull: The Church is <hi>waſhed, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and juſtified in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Saints rely upon God, as Lilies are ſaid to be glorious by his providence. <hi>Why care ye for rayment ſaith Chriſt? learne of the Lilies of the field, how they neither labour nor ſpin, yet I ſay unto you, that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all his glorie, is not clothed like one of theſe, Matthew</hi> 6. 28. Hence we ſhould be taught to relie
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:118024:142"/>
wholly upon God, caſting all our care upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is incident to this delicate and daintie flower, to grow among the perverſe and unbeleevers; the Saints, as Lilies, flouriſh and ſhine among the Thornes. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Wee muſt be blameleſſe, and pure, as the Sonne of God, without rebuke in the midaeſt of a naughty and crooked generation, among whom yee ſhine, as lights in the world, Phil.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>what</hi> and <hi>who</hi> theſe thornes be, is eaſily decided. The naturall thorne is no tender herbe or flower, but a ſturdie hard Tree, not ſmooth as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but knotty and full of dangerous pricks; who theſe thornes be, let <hi>David</hi> declare, in that he ſaith, <hi>The wicked be every one thornes,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 23. 6. where the word <hi>wicked</hi> is expreſſed in the originall by the word <hi>Belial,</hi> which well declareth the nature of wicked men, for that they be (as ſome expound the word) <hi>Beli. gnol, without yoake,</hi> that is ſuch as will not come under the yoake of obe di ence. Others derive it of <hi>Beli</hi> and <hi>Gnalah, not aſcending,</hi> becauſe their matters proſpered not, or, becauſe they were ſuch as aſcended not to the Temple, nor to Mount Zion, the Tabernacle of the Lord. Such baſe earthly ſpirits, ſuch beaſtly rude libertines, they be theſe Thornes.</p>
                  <p>Now wicked men are compared to Thornes, and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Bryers</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> were the fruit of God's curſe upon the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. So are the wicked men of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Bryers</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> they are of a perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, being full of dangerous prickles; ſuch thornes are the wicked, who are continually pricking
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:118024:142"/>
and fretting, and galling the people of God. Hence it is, that when the Lord promiſeth to free his people from ſuch, he ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be no more a pricking bryer to the houſe of Iſrael, nor any grievous thorne, of all that are round about them, that deſpiſed them,</hi> Ezek. 28. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Bryers and thornes, the beſt uſe that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made of them, is but to hedge and fence in: So it is, that God often times makes uſe of theſe Bryers and thornes for the good of his people, ſo as by this meanes, he keeps them from wandring and ſtragling abroad, as Cattle doe out of unfenced paſtures. Thus the Lord tells his people in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Therefore Behold I will hedge up thy way with thornes, and make a wall that ſhee ſhall not find her paths.</hi> A like place we have in <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 55. <hi>If yee will not drive out the Inhabitants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thoſe which ye let remaine of them ſhall be pricks in your eyes, and thornes in your ſides, and ſhall vex you in in the Land wherein you dwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The end of bryers and thornes is to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8. they ſhall be dried and made fit fuell for the fire, and at laſt burned, for which ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>They ſhall be burnt together.</hi> Such will be the end of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, and ſuch as dye in their ſin: <hi>Who would ſet the Briars and thornes againſt me in battaile</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I would goe through them, I would burne them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Thus we ſee what and who theſe thornes be, and in what reſpect wicked men are ſo called: Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that we enquire concerning the love here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
                  <p>3. The love here ſpoken of is the Church (as before <note place="margin">

                     </gap>, in Latine <hi>Malus.</hi> Some thinke that <hi>Malum</hi> an Apple, comes from <hi>Malum</hi> evill, becauſe ſin came firſt into the world by eating of an Apple. But others (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I incline) think that it comes from <hi>Malo,</hi> I more will or deſire, becauſe it is paſſing pleaſing to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it being a fruit which man much deſireth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in. An Apple tree is commended to us in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For its comfortable ſhaddow that it giveth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the following part of the Verſe, it being a tree of a ſpreading nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very fruitfull, as likewiſe appears in this Verſe, the Apple tree is fruitfull above all the trees of the Forreſt, which bring forth no fruit, or elſe they bring forth wild, harſh, and ſowre fruit not fit for food.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apple tree hath more variety of fruits then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other tree whatſoever, ſo that it can hardly be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up how many various ſorts of Apples there be, and that of different taſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is very pleaſant in taſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is very ſweet and refreſhing unto the ſenſe of ſmelling, as thereby a quickning power is conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fainting weake body.</p>
                  <p>Now by this is held out the plentifull ſupply of grace in Chriſt, flowing downe upon all his Members. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Saints find a ſweet ſupply of all grace in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For looke of what uſe and comfort the Apple tree is to mans body, the ſame, and much more is Chriſt unto the ſoule. Chriſt is a ſhaddow of protection unto his people; fruitfull in his communicating of grace, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:118024:144"/>
in variety of all his graces: his fruit is good to the taſt, and ſweet unto the ſences of the ſoul cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting thoſe that are weake by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of thoſe graces to them. Chriſt hath in him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of all grace relative and ſuitable to all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith that he was <hi>eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and a Father to the poore:</hi> ſo is Chriſt made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to Believers, in proportion to their wants. As <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when he raiſed a Child to life, <hi>Put his mouth upon the Childs mouth, his eyes upon the Childs eyes, his hands upon the Childs hands:</hi> ſtill ſimilar parts were applied to ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: ſo doth Chriſt apply himſelfe to us in a relation ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and anſwering to every neceſſity. This of the <hi>Apple tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the place of this Apple trees growth, it is <hi>among the trees of the wood,</hi> or, <hi>of the Forreſt,</hi> or <hi>Grove,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wild trees, begrowne over with moſſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out culter, trees that bring not forth fruit meet for man, that are either barren, or elſe they beare wild, ſowre, bitter, and unſavory fruits, ſuch as is food for Hogs and wild Beaſts rather then for man. Such is the ſtate of all the Sonnes of men by nature, for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. that we are <hi>wild by nature,</hi> not as we were firſt made, but as we were corrupted in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him to his poſterity: and therefore he ſaith, we were <hi>graffed in contrary to nature.</hi> That is, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in to Jeſus Chriſt by ſome means which is above nature. Now Chriſt far excelleth in beauty, fruit, and comfort, all the Sonnes of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the perſon affimilated to the Apple tree, it is Jeſus Chriſt, the Churches <hi>Beloved,</hi> from whom ſhee receives life, health, and every ſaving grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Hebrews expreſſe <hi>Beloved</hi> by the word <hi>Dod,</hi>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:118024:145"/>
which is the ſame in ſignification with <hi>David,</hi> as was hinted before in Chap 1. 13. Chriſt is the Churches Beloved; he loved her firſt, therefore her duty is to love him againe, and therein ſhee faileth not, although ſhee be not able to love him ſo perfectly as ſhee ought, nor in ſuch a meaſure as he loveth her.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the perſons reſembled by the Forreſt trees they are termed <hi>Sonnes,</hi> not <hi>ſonnes of men,</hi> yet the adjunct <hi>(of men)</hi> may be added, and ſo it may be meant of all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom Chriſt far excelleth, as it is ſaid of him in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 3. <hi>Thou art fairer then all the ſonnes of Adam.</hi> The Church conſiders Chriſt not exalted but here on earth, in his eſtate of humiliation: not ſitting in the Heavens, but pitching his Tabernacle among men. And therefore it cannot be that Chriſt is here compared unto the Angells which are called <hi>the ſonnes of God,</hi> Job 1. 6. unto whom, in this eſtate, and in reſpect of taking our nature, and for the ſuffering of death, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inferiour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. but in reſpect of the former ſimilitude of <hi>the trees of the wood,</hi> we may underſtand it of all earthly creatures, as the Kings, and Potentates, and wiſe men of the world; theſe are called <hi>ſonnes,</hi> as the peoples of the world were called <hi>Daughters</hi> in Verſ. 2. Thus the King of <hi>Aſsyria</hi> is likened to a <hi>Cedar in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> under whoſe <hi>ſhaddow dwelt all great Nations,</hi> Ezek. 31. 3. 6. And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is likened to a <hi>tree ſtrong and high under which the beaſts of the Earth dwelt,</hi> &amp;c. So the Church doth extoll her beloved above all the great ones in the world, he being <hi>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. Theſe things remembred, let us ſee what is inferred.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all men by nature are like the Trees of the Forreſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:118024:145"/>
which bring forth nothing but ſowre, bitter, and unſavory fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the fruits that man produceth by any naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it is like the fruit of a wilderneſſe, wild, bitter, and unſavory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt is the Churches Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt loved us and gave himſelfe for us; he loved us when we were not, yea, when we were his enemies we were reconciled unto him; hence it is that the Saints love Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt far excelleth all the great ones of the world, for beauty, ſweetneſſe, and comfort. So is my beloved among the ſonnes,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt was the firſt-borne of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſet above all the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 28. The firſt borne among the Jewes was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and had three prerogatives: firſt, <hi>a double portion of goods,</hi> Deut. 21. 17. Secondly, the <hi>rule or government,</hi> 2 Chron. 21. 3. Thirdly, the <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> Numb. 8. 14. 15. Now Chriſt is called the firſt-borne of God, to ſhew, that he is to be worſhipped and honoured above all things: he is ſaid to be the <hi>firſt-borne of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the firſt-borne of the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence,</hi> Col. 2. 15. 18. And therefore was to be <hi>worſhipped of all the Angells of God,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. And is <hi>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Revel. 1. 5. Thus much for the compariſon it ſelfe, now followeth the fruits or effects thereof.</p>

This comfortable ſhadow, this ſheild of protection, the Saints moſt of all deſire in the ſuns heat of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; hither they flie, as Doves unto their culture houſe, as the Child in the mother lapp; Chriſt was a ſhadow unto his Church in reſpect of the weight of her ſinnes, ſhe being terrifyed with the curſe of the Law, which herſelfe could not beare: now under this
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:118024:147"/>
diſtreſſe of mind, ſhe flyeth unto Chriſt for ſuccour, to be ſhrowded and protected by his grace, and to be covered by his righteouſneſſe from that terrible curſe. When the ſoule is full of reſtleſſe vexations, fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and tumbled up and downe in a whole Ocean of perplexities and fears, and can ſee no ſhoare, no land, no creek or haven of comfort: then it muſt into the Arke, then it uſes the Soliloquie of the Pſalmiſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto thy reſt O my ſoule! then it cries out with the bleſſed Martyr, O! none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt; there's my Arke, there's my reſt, there's my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, there I ſhall fiinde reliefe and releaſement, or elſe no where: Chriſt will be a calme to me after a ſtorme, he will diſpell and drive away all theſe clouds, he will hold my head above the water, and keepe me from ſinking; he will be light and joy, and unſpeakable ſolace after al theſe diſtempers: thus the poore afflicted ſoule, <hi>as a Priſoner of hope</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 12.) returnes unto Chriſt, as to it's ſtrong hold: Chriſt is called the <hi>propitiat orie,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. for as the propitiatorie covered the Arke, and the Law in the Arke, which was <hi>The hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrighting of ordinances againſt us,</hi> Col. 2. 14. from the preſence of God; ſo Chriſt covereth our ſinnes, and putteth himſelfe betweene us and the indignation of his Father.

So that there is no help but to fly to him for ſuccour. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a type of Chriſt, where it is ſaid, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his choſen Servant, ſtood before him in the gapp
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118024:148"/>
to turne away his wrathfull indignation, that he may not deſtroy his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 23. So Chriſt, the Mediator of the new Teſtament, muſt come betweene God and us, that the may not behold us but in him. The Saints finde that in him only is a full ſufficiencie to refreſh them, and to quench and coole all the heat of their ſinnes, and of Gods wrath: farre otherwiſe it is with Idolaters, and ſuch as worſhipp falſe Gods; when they have done all they can, they are not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they finde no eaſe, nor no way to take away the ſting of conſcience; <hi>They multiply their ſorrowes,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. They doe puniſh and afflict themſelves many wayes, ſeeking all meanes to make ſome ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, to coole the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heat of their guilty conſcience, but when they have wearied themſelves, they can finde no eaſe or reſt, for that is only to be found under the ſhadow of this Apple-tree, where the Church here taketh her delight and is ſet downe: ſo that the Churches prayer is the ſame with that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 91. 4. that ſhe might dwell under his protection, and abide under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings, that he would cover her with his feathers; his faithfulneſſe and truth being applyed to her by faith, it may become hers, and ſo be unto her a ſhield and buckler.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In that ſhe doth not only delight under his ſhadow, but addeth, <hi>his fruit is ſweet unto my palate, or tast:</hi> Obſerve, <hi>That the Saints are ſweetly, and fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with all good things in Chriſt.</hi> All the faithfull feed upon Chriſt, and are nouriſhed with all heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, even with all the fruits of his mediatour-ſhip. And what is wanting in him? <hi>Who is made unto us of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:118024:148"/>
God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>It pleaſed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in Chriſt, ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, Col.</hi> 1. 19. from whom wee receive all <hi>ſpirituall bleſsings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places.</hi> The water of the Rock and the Manna in the Wilderneſſe were the ſignes, that Chriſt ſhould ſpiritually feed and refreſh his people. Now from the redundancy and overflowing fulneſſe of all good things in Chriſt, the Saints have there ſufficiencie and fulneſſe, <hi>Of his fulneſſe wee receive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1. 16. that is, graces anſwerable to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable grace of Chriſt, that as face anſwers face in water: ſo we may be made anſwerable to our head; now then let us eate of theſe apples in <hi>faith,</hi> digeſt them by meditation, and we ſhall find in them more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in their Manna,; taſt, and ſee how good the Lord is, as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 8. every fruit of Chriſt's mediation, is an Apple of life, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leafe of this Tree, ſerveth to heale the Nations withall, <hi>Revel.</hi> 23. 2. Now the Church being fully ſatisfied with all good things from Chriſt, which ſhe doth here declare, not only by this allegorie of an Apple-tree, but alſo by a banquet, for ſhe addeth in the next verſe, ſaying:</p>

                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>To the banquetting houſe.</head>
                     <p>In the originall it is, <hi>Beith haijn, domum vini, the houſe of wine:</hi> it muſt needs be meant of the wine-cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the place where wine is kept; or the banquetting houſe where wine is drunk, for Cellers are called the <hi>Treaſuries, or store-houſes of wine,</hi> in <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 27. now becauſe a wine-Cellar is a low vault under the ground, dark, and cold, it may rather be taken for the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qeutting-houſe, alluding to Kings of the earth, who uſe to entertaine one another in ſumptuous and royall banquetting houſes.</p>
                     <p>Now wine is very comfortable to the nature of man it ſlacketh his thirſt, it cheareth his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 15. it cauſeth him to forget his ſorrow and miſerie, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6. 7. it comforteth the ſick by cheriſhing and augmenting the vitall ſpirits, it is alſo ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to God, becauſe it was offered up in ſacrifice, (as I obſerved in Chap. 1. verſ. 1.) by a Synechdoche, it is put for all fragrant, ſweet, and comfortable things in the world. Now by this, the Church ſignifies an increaſe of grace from Chriſt; the ſhadow of Chriſt was a comfort unto her. but to be fed under that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with delectable fruit, that cauſed greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: but now to be brought into a banquetting houſe and to be refreſhed with fragrant wine, this muſt needs be exceeding, and farre more comfortable unto her; foraſmuch as the fruit of the Vine excelleth the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:118024:150"/>
fruit of the Apple-tree, and is much more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the heart.</p>
                     <p>Hence, Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts love unto his Church, increaſeth more and more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is like <hi>Nilus</hi> and <hi>Jordans</hi> waters overflowing their banks, not that Chriſts love doth admit of any increaſings, or decayings: but in reſpect of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations thereof, it is ſometimes augmented for the ſpirituall conſolation of his Church: for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle: <hi>For as the ſufferings of Christ abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 5. And <hi>Iſraell ſhall grow from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 84. 7. Chriſts love never leſſenneth, nor decayeth; but it is conſtant and firme, it is like the water of the ſanctuarie, which abounded more and more, it begins in a drop and ends in an Ocean; and like a ſparke converteth into ſuch a flame, as that it ſhall conſume all droſſe and ſtubble before it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By this banquetting houſe, is noted all thoſe rich and coſtly things which Chriſt and his Church doth banquet withall, which are not traſh and droſſe, and beggarly ſcraps, but thoſe rich and precious delicates of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt communicateth all his ſweet gifts to his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt doth communicate his Spirit unto his Saints, with all the fruits thereof, as <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentlenes, meekneſſe, temperance,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. 23. And the Saints are never ſatisfied untill Chriſt have filled their ſoules with divine graces,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:118024:150"/>
which they are made partakers of by faith: they feed upon Chriſt Crucified. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed,</hi> John 6. That is, true ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all food. In Chriſt there is all fullneſſe, whom then can the Saints want? For if there be light in the Sunne the Aire cannot be darke: if there be ſap in the ſtock, the branches cannot be dry: if there be fullneſſe in the Fountaine, the ſtreams cannot be empty. Chriſt is the Olive-tree that ſtandeth before the ruler of the whole Earth, and emptieth it ſelfe by the pipes and Conduits of his word, into the golden Candleſticks of his Church, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. Light and grace in the miniſtration of holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances flow from him; for in him there's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there's life, there's peace, there's joy, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable and glorious, as the Apoſtle ſaith, I <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this houſe of wine we may underſtand it of the Scriptures, or of the aſſembly of the Saints who are the houſe of God, and unto whom is afforded all ſpirituall comforts ſignified by wine. And thus <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> (which is meant of Chriſt) is ſaid to <hi>have built her houſe,</hi> Prov. 9. 1. That is, Chriſt who is the ſupreame wiſdome, yea, wiſdome it ſelfe, hath prepared him a Church, and 'tis added, <hi>ſhee hath hewn out her ſeaven pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</hi> that is, he hath many chiefe props and ſtayes which are principall parts of his Church: his houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built, in Verſ. 2. he prepares for to make a great Banquet, the Text ſaith, <hi>She hath killed her Beaſts, ſhee hath mingled her wine, ſhee hath alſo furniſhed her Table.</hi> Wiſdome is compared to a ſtately Queene that makes a Feaſt, and keeps open houſe (as we uſe to ſay) for all commers: So is the Kingdome of Heaven likened to a <hi>King that married his ſonne,</hi> Mat. 22. 2. <hi>And they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118024:151"/>
and happy which are called to this ſupper,</hi> Revel. 19. 9. And in that it is ſaid, <hi>ſhee hath mingled her wine,</hi> it allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who, becauſe of the hotneſſe of their Countryes, did uſe to powre out, or mingle their wine with water, to allay the heat of it. So doth Chriſt quallifie and fit heavenly food, and makes it ſuitable to our appetites. Now wiſdome hath <hi>built her houſe, and mingled her wine,</hi> &amp;c, inviteth the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come, <hi>and eat of her bread, and drinke of her wine,</hi> Verſ. 5. And ſo Chriſt in <hi>Song</hi> 5. 1. ſaith, <hi>Eat O my Friends, drinke yee, drinke abundantly, O beloved.</hi> Thus much for the firſt favour of Chriſt towards his Spouſe, to wit, his conveying her into the houſe of wine. The ſecond favour manifeſted by Chriſt to his Church fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>And his banner over me was love.</head>
                     <p>The ſpreading of a Banner, or the lifting up of a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, is mentioned in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 22. <hi>Behold (ſaith the Lord) I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up my ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to the people,</hi> &amp;c. The end of Gods ſeting up his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard here is noted to be for the drawing in of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> which banner muſt needs be meant of the diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell. And Chriſt layed open in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is ſaid to <hi>ſtand for an Enſigne of the people, and to him ſhall the Gentiles ſeeke,</hi> Iſa. 11. 10. And <hi>he ſhall be ſet an Enſigne for the Nations,</hi> Verſ. 12. This Banner or Enſign hath alluſion to the manner of Captaines, who by their ſetting up of their Enſigne doe gather their Souldiers together. So Chriſt the Captaine of our ſalvation, doth gather and draw a people to himſelfe by the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his Standard of the Goſpell, and by diſplaying the colours of his truth. The ſtandard of his word of life
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118024:151"/>
he lifts up among his people, calling them by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his banner unto himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the diſplaying of a Banner ſignifies terrour to the adverſaries, and victory to the Church; ſhee is ſaid to be <hi>terrible as an Army with Banners,</hi> Cant. 6. 4. 10. And the Church in ſigne of victory, ſaith, <hi>Wee will ſhout joyfully in thy Salvation, and in the name of our God we will ſet up the Banner,</hi> Pſal. 20. 6. The Iſraelites were every one to pitch by his owne Standard, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. 2. So muſt the Saints pitch under Chriſts Standard of victory and defence.</p>

                        <hi>That Chriſt obtaineth victory over all his enemies, and is a defence to his owne people.</hi> But we are farther told where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this Enſigne was made and ſet up, and that was of <hi>Love, His banner over me was Love. Love,</hi> here is meant of that wherewith Chriſt hath loved us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10 by which he redeemed his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. This love is the Enſigne, that he diſplayes over us for provoking us to come unto him; yea, all his ſeverall loves are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in his glorious Goſpell, as an Enſigne or Banner to gather together unto him all his Saints.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That all the Saints and choſen of God are drawne unto Chriſt by his love.</hi> For the love of Chriſt is the Enſigne ſpread, by which he draweth all his Saints unto him: and none are drawne, but thoſe onely over whom the ſame Enſigne is diſplayed. Now this banner is ſpread, when the Goſpell is preached, and the riches of Chriſt's love laid open, whereby the faithfull are drawne to Chriſt. What love is like to his, <hi>who hath given himſelfe for us, when we were his Enemies?</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>Who waſhed us in his owne blood,</hi> Rev. 1. Here then is the principle and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118024:152"/>
ground of all our obedience, or of our praiſe, and that is love, which love is wrought in our hearts by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of the banner of Chriſt's love over us. All that we can doe is nothing if there be not this principle of love: hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. And we read of the woman in the Goſpell which waſhed the feet of the Lord with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head: from whence proceeded all this? Was it not becauſe ſhee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much? And why did ſhee love much? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Many ſins were forgiven her.</hi> Shee had felt the banner of his love ſpread over her in forgiving her many ſins, and this did draw her to love him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. The Apoſtle doth reckon up all the fruits of Chriſts ſpreading of his love abroad in the hearts of the Saints, ſaying, <hi>We rejoyce in tribulations being juſtified by ſaith, knowing that tribulation bringeth patience, patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, experience hope, hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is given to us,</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 4, 5. When the ſoul comes to the aſſurance of faith, by the diſplaying of Chriſts banner of love in the Goſpell, then neither tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, nor anguiſh, perſecution or famine, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or perill of ſword, ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of Chriſt, but they ſhall be more then Conquerours through him that loves them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Hence learn what is the chiefe duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpell, namely, to ſpread before men the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſt's love; yea, to publiſh and lay open the riches of his love to mankind, in offering himſelfe to be a ranſome for the ſins of the world, to draw men out of carnall miſery, unto a moſt happy, ſpirituall, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118024:152"/>
condition. Then extoll and lift up the Enſigne of Chriſt's love, and diſplay the banner thereof, that men may be gathered in unto it. The Miniſters of the Goſpell ſhould ſpend their whole force this way, that men may be drawne to Chriſt; who will ſeek after that which he knows not of? And who would not ſeeke after ſome precious Jewell? O then! tell people where this Jewell, this pearle, this treaſure is, that they may ſeeke after it: Diſplay the Enſigne of Chriſt's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercy, grace, and love, that people may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to praiſe Chriſt, and yeild obedience unto him. So far concerning the narration of Chriſt's favours; now followeth the Churches requeſt.</p>

Chriſt, for ſuch is the condition of the Church often. Now love is one of the ſtrongeſt affections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſickneſſe ariſing from it, muſt needs be very ſore; as may be ſeene in the example of <hi>Ammon,</hi> who was ſick of love for his Siſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 13. 1, 2, &amp;c. now this ſickneſſe growing from love, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what love is.</p>
                     <p>It is an affection or motion whereby the will is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, with deſire of ſome good thing, with a ſtrong deſire after the fruition of that good, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the ſoule. The cauſe then by which the heart is ſtirred, is the goodneſſe of ſome object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the ſenſe, and by the ſenſe propounded to the heart.

                     <p>Firſt, The ſence and feeling of Gods wrath due to her for ſinnes, and the curſe of the Law, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 8. where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſinnes in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Whereupon it is ſaid, <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay I am ſick; the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquitie, Iſa.</hi> 33. 24. when their ſinns were forgiven, their ſickneſſe was healed.</p>

                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt tels us, <hi>That the whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick, Matth.</hi> 9. 12. Sin-ſick ſinners will enquire and ſeeke the Phyſitian of ſoules. The ſenſe of miſerie is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the firſt mover, that ſets the ſoule in fainting and longing after Chriſt, for when the ſoule findes it ſelfe in darkneſſe without light, lying under the guilt of ſinne, and not able
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:118024:156"/>
to deliver it ſelfe, this cannot but make it looke out for it ſelfe, and ſeeke with great importance for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The Dove could find no reſt for the ſoale of her foot, till ſhe returned into the Arke. The Saints are very impatient of Chriſts abſence; for he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe for a while; he may withdraw his light and comfort from the ſoule, though he take not a way his love, yet he may ſuſpend the Acts of his love, he may ſeeme to frowne, he may ſo abſcond and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe his love, that the ſoule for a time loſeth ſenſe, and feeles not its owne happineſſe. Now when it is thus, Chriſt ſeemes to be gone, the comfort and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love is gone, joy and light is gone, O! how dejected, how diſconſolate is the ſoule then! It is a perfect hyeroglyphick or reſemblance of <hi>A wounded ſpirit,</hi> as <hi>Solomon cals</hi> it, when the ſoule is full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and feares, and can ſee no comfort; then it muſt returne to Chriſt, as to its ſtrong hold, there is my ſtay, there is my comfort, there I ſhall finde reliefe and refreſhment, or elſe no where. Or elſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Wee may take the cauſe of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſickneſſe the object, to wit, the ſight of Chriſts loves, diſplayed by his banner, and by taſting of his banquet, even all the varietie of his ſweet graces: now becauſe her minde (which is the eye of the ſoule) could not ſuſtaine the glittering ſhine of his love, no more then <hi>Job</hi> could ſhut up the Sea with doores, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 8. or <hi>Agur</hi> cloſe up the winds in his fiſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. hereupon ſhe is as one in a Syncope or fit of ſwoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being overcome with the bright and glorious beams of his love; as it was ſaid of the Queene of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> (according to Hiſtorians) who had no Spirit

left in her, becauſe ſhe was aſtoniſhed at <hi>Solomons</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, riches, wiſedom, and the like: So here the Church having both ſights and taſts of Chriſt love and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is as it were overcome with it.</p>

                        <hi>That the fulneſſe of Chriſts love to his Saints, doth as it were, tranſport and overcome them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church had been in the houſe of wine, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting with Chriſt; and under the diſplaying of the banner of his love, upon which ſhe cryeth out, <hi>I am ſick of love,</hi> I am overwhelmed and overcome with his ſweetneſſe, hereupon her heart was ſo much raviſhed with love, that ſhe is love-ſick, and ready to ſwoon therewith. Or,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Wee may take her ſickneſſe to be her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding love towards Chriſt, that her heart is ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with love towards him, that ſhe is ſick. Love hath a ſtrong appetition of peculiarity, or private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the thing beloved: Here is a marveilous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love in the Church towards Chriſt: Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation, the ſimilitude is drawn from hence, when a Virgine is betrothed, and through the vehemencie of her love towards her Spouſe, is ſick, and ſwooneth; a greater or a more vehement love cannot be.</p>
                     <p>Hence, Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints love to Chriſt, is vehement and ſtrong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Church is ſo taken and raviſhed with love towards Chriſt, that ſhe is love-ſick, and ready to ſwoone, and with a patheticall exclamation crie th out, as one that is ready to depart and dye, ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:118024:157"/>
to be refreſhed with the ſweet water of life, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto her in flagons, and the ſweet ſmelling A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fetch out of Chriſts treaſury, and both held and applyed to her, that by that meanes ſhe might be, as it were recovered of her ſickneſſe. The faithfull ſoule taſting the ſweetnes of thoſe Aples, &amp; of that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wine, hath ſuch a deſire of Chriſt, as that ſhe cannot be any meanes be ſatisfied without the enjoyment of him. Here then is a ſickneſſe, but not to death, but unto life and ſatisfaction. Chriſt himſelfe pronounceth ſuch <hi>Bleſſed, that doe hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they ſhall be filled, Matth.</hi> 5. 6. The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe Apples which ſhe taſted, and of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wine, brought her into this paſſion: yet her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and deſire of them, is not any thing at all dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but ſhe deſireth to be more refreſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with thoſe flagons of wine, and to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto her ſelf thoſe ſweet apples of Chriſt. When Chriſt doth firſt lead a ſoule into his Wine-Cellar, and doth refreſh it at the heavenly banquet of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights and comforts, he doth not diſtribute out a full meaſure of his ſpirit and grace, but as it were ſome taſts, or ſmall drops of them, which the Apoſtle cals <hi>The firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 23. And <hi>The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 1. Now by theſe drops the Saints are ſo taken and raviſhed, with the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſweetneſſe there is in thoſe heavenly things, that they are inſatiable in their deſire after a more plentifull meaſure of them. Thus for the Churches requeſt, with the reaſon thereof. Now followeth the fruit or effect of her requeſt.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt Verſe we had the Churches diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, here we have the remedy. Shee called out to the Miniſters of Chriſt to help her in the former verſe, but it appears here that it is onely Chriſt that can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply cure: Indeed they be inſtruments, and no more, for <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but it is God that can give increaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. It is Chriſt himſelfe that is able to ſupport his Church by his divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.

                  <p>In theſe words, obſerve, The Churches declaration of Chriſts exceeding loue towards her: and this love of Chriſt appeareth in one generall act of favour, namely, his ſweet embracing her, which embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt needs argue love and favour.</p>
                  <p>In Chriſts embracements of his Church, wee have two particulars.</p>

comfort her heart by his word and Spirit, as a loving Husband doth his wife in her ſorrow and ſickneſſe, for ſo the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>That Chriſt nouriſheth his Church, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 29. Seeing theſe things are ſpirituall, what may be meant by the <hi>left</hi> and <hi>right hand?</hi> for the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this myſtery, wee cannot bring in that of Chriſts right and left hand, ſpoken of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. becauſe the left hand is turned to the wicked: but both hands here doe uphold the Church. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the left hand of Chriſt his <hi>man-hood,</hi> and by his right hand, his <hi>God-head.</hi> But I underſtand it here of whole Chriſt embracing of her, with both hands as it were, both his God head and man-hood, his life, death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, even all that is Chriſts, is imployed for the good and comfort of his people.</p>
                     <p>The forme of ſpeech may alſo ſeeme to allude to their feaſts, when they lay on the ground, ſo that if any fainted, they put one hand under them to lift them up, and gave them ſome comfortable potion with the other. In like manner, Chriſt doth not leave his Church in her ſorrow and ſickneſſe, but imbraceth her with his owne hands, in the manifeſtation of all love, and mercy, and keepeth her ſafe from evill. Now if wee take the words for a narration, then the comfort of Chriſts goodneſſe and mercy is ſet forth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing his people by his word and ſpirit. But if wee take them prayer-wiſe, <hi>Let him embrace me, &amp;c.</hi> then they hold forth the faith and thankfulneſſe of the Church, becauſe ſhee ſeeth Chriſt preſent, adminiſtring comfort to her, even in a fainting condition.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter, wee have ſeene how Chriſt calling himſelfe a Roſe and a Lilie, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to underſtand, that in him is the Fountaine of all grace, and the fulneſſe and perfection of all ſweet and heavenly treaſures.

                     </gap>ly that ſhe excelleth all other Daughters, as farre as the pure white Lilie doth the Thornes. Then ſhe ſetteth forth the praiſe of her well beloved, by a like compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; namely, that as the Apple-tree excelleth the trees of the forreſt: ſo doth he excell the Sonnes.</p>
                  <p>And further ſhe declareth, that by the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhadow, and fruit of this tree, ſhe being led into the houſe of wine, ſhe is made partaker of all heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings in him, and by the feeling of his love, ſhe is ſick of love towards him, calling for a further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of grace, and is embraced, comforted, and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt. All which is contained in the firſt ſix verſes of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:118024:159"/>
Now to proceed. In theſe three Verſes we have.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſtrict charge given, that this peace ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, may not be interrupted, verſe 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Declaration of <hi>Meſſiahs</hi> comming, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the diſcovery thereof, verſes, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Wee have a vehement charge given to all the Members of the Church, <hi>I charge you O ye Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The manner of the charge, <hi>By the Roes and Hindes of thee Feild.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The matter of the charge, <hi>That yee ſtirre not, nor awake my love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The duration or continuance of the charge, <hi>untill be pleaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here ariſeth ſome difficultie, to finde out whether it be Chriſt or his Church that giveth this charge; by ſome of our Engliſh tranſlations, it ſeemes to be Chriſt, becauſe it is read, <hi>That you awake not my love untill ſhe pleaſe;</hi> for if it were the Church, ſhe ſhould ſay, <hi>That you awake not my love untill be pleaſe.</hi> But it is not very eaſily diſcuſſed by the Hebrew text: for the word <hi>Ahabhah, love,</hi> is feminine: and if the Church call Chriſt her love, the conſtruction is with a verbe of the feminine gender. Some doe expound this charge to be Chriſts, which he ſhould give unto the falſe Brethren, and falſe Churches, ſuch as were degenerate Aſſemblies of Idolaters, that they doe not moleſt that ſweet peace and reſt of the Church, which ſhe had obtained in him. But I rather take it, to be the charge of the Church, not to her falſe Siſters, but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:118024:160"/>
unto her companions, that they doe not by any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage or rude behaviour of theirs, cauſe Chriſt to withdraw himſelfe, or to hide or ecclipſe his love.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of this interpretation are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The originall will indifferently beare ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, She had authority to command, as ſhee doth in verſe 15. ſaying, <hi>Take us the Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words preceding, and following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are the words of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, She doth apply the words unto the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> her fellow friends, unto whom ſhee often ſpeaketh, as in Chap. 1. verſ. 5.</p>
                  <p>Let us now deſcend downe unto the words in particular.</p>

where he dwels, and holds forth the word of life, and diſtributes the rich treaſures of grace and glory, and doth beutifie it with all heavenly excellencies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Jeruſalem was the joy of the whole earth, Pſal.</hi> 48. 2. So is the Church, the joy and comfort of the word; what are all the men in the world beſides? the Church is the ſeate of ſaving truth, and is built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, ſo that the Church is the depoſitory of the truth, that orbe out of which this glorious light ſhines forth; and unto the Church pertains the Covenant, and the promiſes as you heard before. So much for the Parties charged.</p>

This is ſpoken by the Church, after the manner of men and their wives, who when they would talke off ſecret matters, or take their reſt and be quiet, will bid their Children and ſervants get them abroad, and recreate themſelves, where they will, for a while.

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Roes</hi> and <hi>Hinds</hi> are wild Beaſts of the Field, <note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Roes</hi> and <hi>Hinds</hi> are ſet forth in Scripture for their ſwiftneſſe of foot, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 18. which being referred to Gods judgements, may ſignifie the ſwiftneſſe of Gods judgement on them that ſhal break this adjuration.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe creatures are alſo commended for their mutuall love one to another: by them is the love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife ſet forth, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Let her be as the loving Hind, and as the pleaſant Roe,</hi> &amp;c. That as the Males and Females of theſe Beaſts doe dearly love one another, ſo is the unfeighned love betweene man and wife, and alſo betweene Chriſt and his Church; for Chriſt himſelfe is likened to a <hi>Roe, or young Hart,</hi> in Verſ. 9.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe Beaſts are very much deſirous of the

So ſhould the Saints walk on high places, and not remaine below on Mountaines of Earth, but we ſhould Mount up to Heaven in our hearts, the hill of Gods holineſſe, and of our happineſſe, unto which <hi>Paul</hi> aſcended in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſoul, and unto which <hi>Stevens</hi> heart and eye was lifted up in the end of his Apology, becauſe his defence was in the Heavens. All our Salvation, joy, and happineſſe, commeth not from the Mountaines of fleſh and blood, but from the Heavens.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Theſe creatures were often made a prey, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reached by the Huntſman; therefore Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is called <hi>Aijeleth Kaſhacar, The Hind of the morning,</hi> Pſal. 22. 1. Who in that Pſalme is extreamly hunted with Doggs of the Evening: ſo are all the Saints hunted by the men of the world.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

And the Church then ſtirreth up the Lord, when it earneſtly prayeth for ſuch deliverance, as in <hi>Pſal. 44. 23.

                     <p>Or, it may be meant of Chriſt's comming in the fleſh, and then we muſt take it thus: the Daughters
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:118024:164"/>
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are charged to ſuffer affliction under the Law, being ſhut up unto the faith that ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, which Law was a School-maſter unto Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. And the Church was as a Child in her non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, under Tutors and Governors, under the Law, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the appointed time of the Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 1, 2. Now I ſay according to this Interpretation, they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to waite in faith and patience, unto the comming of the Lord, as it is in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 5. 6, 7. and not to provoke him by Murmuring, or otherwiſe, through feare or unbeliefe. Now from this weighty charge, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That we ought to be carefull not to diſquiet Jeſus Chriſt, whilſt he ſeeks our quiet.</hi> The Apoſtle adviſeth us not to <hi>grieve the holy Spirit,</hi> adding this reaſon, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by it yee are ſealed unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 30. So are we alſo on the other hand to pleaſe the Spirit, as we would not turne away the Seale of our ſalvation The Prophet tells the reaſon why the Lord fought againſt his people, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 63. 10.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt is the Churches love.</hi> The love of the Saints may be divided and branched out to creatures, ſome love to one creature, and ſome to another, but all the ſtreame of their affections meet in Chriſt, as the Rivers meet in the Sea, and as the Sun-beams meet in the Sun. As Chriſt eternall, exceeding, rich love is faſtened onely upon the Church, for indeed his love grows and plants it ſelfe there: So a believers love is fixed onely upon Chriſt, as upon its proper and onely object.</p>

Thirdly, in that this adjuration is limitted to the Beloveds will and good pleaſure: if we take it for provoking by ſin: Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That our great care muſt be, not at any time to ſin againſt Chriſt, to provoke him to wrath. Job</hi> ſaith that <hi>faire weather commeth out of the North, but with God is terrible Majeſty,</hi> Job 37. 22. The meaning of it is this, that though the creature may be pleaſing and flexible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and there may be faire quarter betweene man and man: yet not ſo with God; if he be once provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with him is terrible and dreadfull majeſty: and thus it is ſaid of Chriſt in the forenamed place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>Beware of him, and obey his voyce, provoke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions, for my name is in him.</hi> When we ſin againſt God, we have a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to goe unto: but when we ſin againſt Chriſt we have no Mediator unto him, therefore it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to ſin againſt Chriſt, for then indeed we ſin againſt a Mediator.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if we take this limitation to the beloveds good pleaſure, for his comming in the fleſh, when ſhe might injoy a greater manifeſtation of his preſence: then Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints are patiently to wait for thoſe good things that are promiſed them in Chriſt.</hi> Here the Daughters were adjured not to provoke Chriſt by unbeliefe, or impatience or murmuring, but patiently to wait for Chriſts appearance. Suitable unto this is that of the Apoſtle when he tells the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that <hi>after they had done the will of God, they had need of patience, that they might receive the promiſe,</hi> Heb. 10. 36. That is, they were patiently, without grudging or murmuring, to wait for the good things promiſed them. The Saints
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:118024:165"/>
that lived before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, were to wait with patience for the day of his appearance: and ſo now the Saints ſince his comming in the fleſh, muſt alſo wait for his laſt comming in glory, as we have it in the Apoſtle <hi>James. Be patient therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>

                        <hi>unto the comming of the Lord,</hi> James 5. 7.

                     <p>Thus far of the Charge given to the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not to provoke or ſtir up Chriſt by ſin, or to be impatient of his comming. Now followeth a declaration of Meſſiah's comming, together with the diſcovery thereof.</p>

                     <head>The voyce of my beloved.</head>
                     <p>By <hi>the voyce</hi> here is meant the word of Chriſts grace, and the Preaching of the Goſpell, which the Church knoweth to be Chriſts voyce, and therefore receiveth it with joy: now in that ſhee doth acknowledge his voyce notwithſtanding her former diſtempers. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints doe and may diſcerne the voyce of Chriſt, yea, and that in a weake and diſtempered condition.</hi> This is teſtified by Chriſt, when he ſaith <hi>Every one that is of truth heareth my voyce,</hi> John 18. 37. And againe he ſaith, <hi>My Sheep heare my voyce,</hi> John 10. 3. And <hi>they know not the voyce of Strangers,</hi> Verſ. 4. It is ſaid of the Jewiſh Rulers that dwelt in <hi>Jeruſalem, that they knew not the voyce of the Prophets,</hi> Acts 12. 27. That is, they ſlighted their doctrines, and hearkned not unto them. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>to day if yee will heare his voyce,</hi> Heb. 3.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:118024:166"/>
7. Now the Sheep of Chriſt they can diſcerne Chriſts voyce, they can (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) <hi>taſt words by the eare,</hi> Job 12. 11. They have a ſpirituall taſt, a diſcerning reliſh in their ears, becauſe they have the Spirit of God, and therefore reliſh what is ſuitable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But now the great Queſtion is, <hi>How we ſhall know the Voyce of Chriſt from the voyce of ſtrangers? How ſhall we underſtand the word, and know the truth from error, light from darkneſſe,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                     <p>For anſwer hereunto, conſider.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Voyce of Chriſt hath a ſupernaturall power and majeſty in it, which carries its owne evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it. How doe we know light to be light but by that evidence of light that it hath in it ſelfe? How doe we know fire to be fire but by that evidence of heat that it hath in it ſelfe? So the word and voyce of Chriſt carries ſuch a majeſty and power with it, to caſt downe, to raiſe up, to kill, and make a live, that it carries its owne evidence in it ſelfe. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the word of prophecy doth judge and convince the unbeleiver, and it <hi>makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the ſecrets of the heart,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25. That is, the unbeleivers falſe perſwaſions of God, and his luſts and deſires ſhall be diſcovered and convinced by the word. And againe he ſaith, <hi>For the weapons of our warfare</hi> (meaning the ſpirituall applying of the word to the reſiſting of their enemies) <hi>are not carnall</hi> (ſuch as naturall men have recourſe unto, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

by the Spirit, and puniſhing thoſe that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Goſpell, by the <hi>pulling downe of ſtrong holds, caſting downe imaginations</hi> (or the reaſonings of the ſoul) <hi>and every high thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. No ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe power being able to ſtand before the power of Chriſts voyce, or to withſtand it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Saints have the ſpirit of Chriſt <hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> John 14. 16. That is, not ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but into all truth neceſſary for them to know, whereby they may judge and diſcerne of the voyce of Chriſt: So that the Saints have a faculty to diſcerne of ſuch food as is agreeable unto them: and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that which is not fit nouriſhment, and to let it goe. As there are in nature, paſſages fit for concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and digeſtion, and alſo for rejection; ſo there is in the ſouls of the Saints, to receive that which is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, and fit for the ſoul and Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may ſay, How ſhall we out of our owne breaſts, without the allowance and approbation of thoſe that are learned, be aſſured that it is the holy Ghoſt that doth ſo guide us in the way of truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> for aſſurance of our ſalvation, and that we are undoubtedly the Children of God, alledgeth, <hi>That we have received the Spirit of adoption, and that Spirit beareth witneſſe to our Spirits, that we are the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 16. Now it may as well be demanded of them, that feel this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in their ſouls, how they know it to be the true Spirit of God which doth aſſure them? which is to contradict the Apoſtle, and to deny the principles of Religion, againſt ſuch there is to be no diſputation.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:118024:167"/>
The ſame Spirit which doth witneſſe unto us, that we are the Children of God, and cannot deceive, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſure us of the true voyce of Chriſt, in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scriptures, and it doth aſſure us ſo, that we cannot be deceived. It is true, that <hi>the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. The divine writings of God will not ſtoop to the naturall ſpirit of man, neither will the divine Scriptures be underſtood, but of ſuch as have received the Spirit of Heaven, and them unto whom the Lamb Jeſus Chriſt ſhall unſeale the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. Therefore we muſt bring the Spirit of the Scriptures, for the underſtanding of the Scriptures, and <hi>he that is ſpirituall</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>judgeth all things,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 2. 15. That is, the ſpirituall man diſcerneth and underſtandeth all things which are of God, and that belong unto eternall life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that the Church ſaith, <hi>It is the voyce of my beloved,</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt is beloved of his Church in what condition ſoever ſhee is in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although the Church were weake and ready to faint, and felt but little divine aſſiſtance, neither had ſhee but ſmall diſcoveries of Chriſt, yet ſhee ſaith, <hi>It is the voyce of my beloved.</hi> The Saints, even in ſpiritual deſertions, when Chriſt hideth his face, and vaileth himſelfe from the ſoul: I ſay, then the Saints are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wel-pleaſed in Chriſt, though the tentation be full of amarulency and bitterneſſe, yet in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there is abundant ſweetneſſe and ſatisfaction. Hence was that reſolution of <hi>Job, Though he kill mee,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:118024:168"/>
yet I will truſt in him.</hi> Hence it is alſo ſaid of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>That though they walke in darkneſſe, and have no light at all, yet they will truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay themſelves upon their God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. Believers can ſay in the middeſt of feares, tentations, and afflictions, <hi>It is the voice of my beloved.</hi> Thus much for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches acknowledgement of her ſenſe, and feeling of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiahs</hi> approaching, and gracious diſcovery of himſelfe unto her, and that by the diſcerning of his voice.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth the acknowledgement ſhe makes of Chriſt by his pace, which is prefaced with a word of attention, and after ſet forth, to be very ſpeedy in theſe words.</p>

                        <hi>Behold!</hi> is a word of attention, of admiration, and of aſſeveration, as you heard in chap. 1. 15. Behold how my beloved comes running like an <hi>Hinde.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>When the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foreſaw Chriſt comming to aſſume fleſh, he cries out, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:118024:168"/>
the gracious diſcoveries of himſelfe unto us, in this laſt age of the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre the preface: Now followeth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his comming, which is firſt ſet forth to bee ſpeedy.</p>

                  <div type="phrase">

                     <p>The manner of Chriſts comming, is ſet forth unto us by the ſimilitude taken from the <hi>Roes</hi> and <hi>Harts</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Chriſt is likned in the next verſe) which are ſwift and ſpeedy in their running, and skip upon hills and rocks: as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of the Goſpell, ſaith, <hi>The lame man ſhall leape as an Hart, Iſaiah</hi> 35. 6. that is, he ſhall goe on evenly and ſtraightly, he ſhall walke nimbly and cheerefully in the wayes of God. Hereby then is meant the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe and readineſſe of Chriſts comming, either to help and ſupport his people, or elſe his comming in the fleſh, when he would more fully diſcover himſelfe in a Goſpel-miniſtration.</p>

                     <p>Theſe words doe marvelouſly expreſſe Chriſts ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular love, as though the Church ſhould ſay, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the journey, the hardneſſe of the way, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe as mans power, or the like, can hinder him from comming to comfort me: but he will paſſe all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments whatſoever, as the ſinnes of his people, and the oppoſition of the world, and the like.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:118024:169"/>
to prepare the way before Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Every mountaine and hill ſhall be made low.</hi> So the adverſaries of the Church are compared to a <hi>Mountaine,</hi> in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who art thou, O great mountaine? before Zerubbabell, thou ſhalt become a plaine.</hi> So that notwithſtanding the ſinnes of his people, and the oppoſition of the world, Chriſt declareth his comming, by his voice, to comfort his people.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That nothing can keepeback, or ſeparate Chriſt from his Church, his love is ſo great towards her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be as it were high hils and mountaines of ſins, in the people of God, which might ſeparate: and the Devill raiſeth up bankes to make the way unpleaſant, but he paſſeth over all theſe high mountaines: The Apoſtle tels us, that his love is ſo abundant, <hi>As neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. 38, 39. Hence it is, even from that unſeperable love of Chriſt, towards his Church, ſhe ſo glorieth ſaying, <hi>Behold he commeth leaping over the mountaines,</hi> &amp;c. that is, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth without let or hinderance, though our ſinnes be as great hils and mountains, which make a great ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or diſtance betweene us, yet he paſſeth over them all. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> compareth the pride of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and their phariſaicall preſumption upon their owne merits, to the mountains, as likewiſe too much dejection of minde, to the valleys, declaring, that by the preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to prepare the way of Chriſt, <hi>Every valley ſhall be exalted, and every mountaine and hill ſhall be made low, and the crooked ſhal be made ſtraight
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:118024:169"/>
and the rough places plaine,</hi> Iſa. 40. 4. That is ſuch as in their owne conceit of workes, are exalted like mountaines, ſhall be caſt downe by the miniſtery of the word; and ſuch as are dejected and caſt downe in their ſpirits, ſhall be comforted and raiſed up.</p>
                     <p>To the godly are incident ſmaller imperfections, which are common to all the Saints, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to little hils, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Wee know that the Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall ſold under ſinne,</hi> ſaith he; for I allow not that which I doe, for, <hi>What I would, that I doe not, and what I hate, that I do, Rom.</hi> 7. 14. 15. And theſe ſmalleſt imperfections are great enough to ſeparate us from God, were it not for Jeſus Chriſt: But ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.

                  <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt is ready, and maketh much ſpeed to helpe and comfort his Church.</hi> Whither we take the meaning of the words for Chriſts approaching neer the ſoul in the diſcoveries of his love and grace, or Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh, for the more generall comfort of his Saints, yet in both, Chriſt is ſwift and ready, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth not when the appointed time is come. Chriſt is more ready to helpe his Saints, then they can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, he is neer unto them that doe not thinke of him, and he is moſt ſtrong when his people are moſt weak: Hence it is, that the Prophet crieth out in his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſaying, <hi>Haſt thee O God to deliver me, make haſt to helpe me O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 70. 1. And againe he ſaith, <hi>I ſtretch forth my hands to thee, my ſoul gaſpeth after thee as a thirſty Land: Heare me O Lord, and that right ſoone, for my Spirit waxeth faint, hide not thy face from me leſt I be like one which goeth downe to the pit: O let me heare of thy loving-kindneſſe betimes in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 143. 6, 7, 8.

For Chriſt and the New Teſtament-Church, were parted by that wall of Sacrifices, and other Leviticall Ceremonies, during the continuance of that ancient Prieſt-hood.

Here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle declareth, that the Goſpel is full of light, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of us with its glorious beams; and that wee have a free acceſſe to God by the Goſpell, which is not like the darke vaile, that <hi>Moſes</hi> put upon his face, but pure reſplendent glaſſe, wherein the glorious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of God is ſeene by us: and we are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, &amp; as it were glorified in our minds, according to the ſame image of God: and this worke of his is ſtill in progreſſe here in this life, ſo as wee grow from grace to grace, and from glorie to glorie, untill wee be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as Chriſt is perfect. But yet the Church knoweth

Chriſt but in part; for we ſee him but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Now the cauſe of this imperfect ſight of Chriſt is not to be imputed to God, but to our Apoſtaticall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, covered with the vaile of fleſhly underſtanding, to which infirmitie of ours, God hath applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in ſhining out of his glorie unto us; yet ſo, as wee ſee but the image of his glorie in a glaſſe: neither can wee contemplate in that glaſſe, the pure and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked image of God, but it is clothed and wrapped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with an intricacie of words, and corporall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, according to our underſtandings and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: for the brightneſſe of his glorie, no fleſh can behold and live: but hereafter, <hi>Wee ſhall know him as wee are knowne:</hi> that is, wee ſhall know him fully and perfectly.</p>

                     <p>The Church had not uttered one word, but only deſired more comfortable times, and Chriſt gives her in the anſwer of her deſire, <hi>The Lord prepares the heart, and heares the prayer, Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. The Lord doth as well heare and anſwer the prayer of the minde, and of the heart, as the prayer of the lips. <hi>Davids</hi> purpoſe to build the Lord an houſe, was accepted as well as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> actuall building of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus farre Chriſts ſpeech in generall, containing Chriſts anſwer to the ſecret deſire of his Church.</p>

Let us come to the Speech it ſelfe. And firſt of thoſe two Epithites given by him unto his Church.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>My love, my faire one.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My love,</hi> Or <hi>my fellow friend, my companion, familiar:</hi> ſo named of feeding together, and converſing one with another, and ſo partaking each of others good or evill. This title of love is often given by Chriſt to his Church, ſometimes a Husband is called by this name, <hi>friend,</hi> as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 20. there is mention made of a <hi>wife, that deales treacherouſly with her friend:</hi> So Chriſt gives a title unto his Church, ſuitable unto her, as ſhe is his Spouſe, and he her Husband.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts love, ſeates it ſelfe in his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church is the maine object of his love, it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to that, and is not ſcattered to other objects: who can imagine what Chriſts love is to his Churh; <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9. None can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with what love the Father lov'd the Son: no more can any define and fully ſet out what Chriſts love is unto the Saints. The Apoſtle would have the <hi>Epheſians able to comprehend with all Saints, the bredth and length, the depth and height of the love of God in Chriſt:</hi> but yet for all that he concludes, that it <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 18. 19. And indeed there is no love comparable to this love of Chriſt, which is above the love of women, of father or mother, or any earthly love whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the firſt Epithite.</p>

It is a very faire terme for the greater to give unto the leſſer, for Chriſt to give unto his Church: yea, it is a ſigne of ſingular affection for Chriſt to give unto his Church before ſhee was ariſen, before ſhee was comencer unto his preſence. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Church is exceeding beautifull and faire in Chriſts account.</hi> Hence it is he gives here ſuch a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhing title, <hi>My faire one,</hi> &amp;c. It is a very high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion for Chriſt to give to his Church, but he who knows beſt what the Church is, calls her <hi>my faire one.</hi> But how comes the Church to be thus faire? Her fairneſſe is a derivative beauty, ſhee is faire and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſhee is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and cloathed with the robes of his righteouſneſſe: for ſo ſoone as ever we are united to Chriſt, our ſins are upon him, and his righteouſneſs upon us, and therefore in Chriſt the Church is comely. It is Chriſt that gives us life, and puts excellent Ornaments upon us to cover our nakedneſſe, and decks us with Jewells and Chaines of gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo we become beautifull in his ſight, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10, 13.

                        </note> ſignifying, that though no other would, yet he ſhould for his owne good, get him out from that idolatrous place.

with the cares and pleaſures of the fleſh. Hence it is that Chriſt calls her with his continuall voice ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her ears, ariſe, O thou whom I love, which art faire in my ſight, and come away. We are ready to mind earthly things, and to ſet up our reſt here, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! the holy City, where is our freedome, is above: indeed worldlings are not moved at all with the voyce of Chriſt, for they can feele no taſt nor-ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but in worldly things, and it is death to them to heare the voyce of Chriſt to ſay, <hi>Ariſe and come away:</hi> they cannot willingly part with their treaſure whereon they have ſet their hearts; that is to ſay, their Gold, their Silver, their Houſes, and their Lands: but ſuch are not worthy of Chriſt: but let all the Saints hearken unto Chriſt's voyce, and follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth graciouſly invite his people to come from thoſe things he would have them to forſake..</hi> Ariſe, and come away for thy ſelfe, or for thy good. Thus the Lord calls to his people to come out from that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they were in, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the darkneſſe ſhall cover the Earth, and groſſe darkneſſe the people: but the Lord ſhall riſe upon thee, and his glory ſhall be ſeene upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 60. I. When the Lord ſhined forth upon his people in more glorious diſcoveries of himſelfe, he calls them away from their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: when the Lord diſcovered himſelfe in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell diſpenſation, his people were no longer to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the darke cloud of legall ceremonies. Therefore let us follow the Lords call unto any diſpenſation of his, and not to be over confident of our preſent ways,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:118024:177"/>
we muſt remember the Lord did depart out of the Sanctuary into the Temple, and out of the Temple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtry of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and out of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> into that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. We know not what the Lord may yet bring us unto; there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious Prophecyes yet to be fulfilled, and many glorious things are ſpoken of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which ſhall deſcend downe from above, where there ſhall be no need of the light of the Sun, or of the Moon. If the Lord ſhall call us from thoſe wayes wherein we have injoyed God formerly, unto an higher diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: let us be willing to heare his voyce, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth: Our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lies not ſo much in this or that forme, but in the injoyment of our beloved.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Raine is over)</hi> or <hi>changed:</hi> that is, the ſtormes and tempeſts of the winter is paſt away and gone, and faire and pleaſant weather come in the place.

                     <p>Theſe things may be apply'd,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to the bondage of ſin, which may well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the winter; for as a nipping winter deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the beauteous face of a Garden or Orchard, ſo doth ſin deforme and rob a people of their beauty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may apply theſe winter ſtormes and blaſts to outward trouble and grievances in this life, by the malice and perſecution of wicked men: as when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage, and under the captivity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> ſuch times as theſe were winter ſeaſons, full of trouble and tempeſt. Now we may apply it unto the ſpirituall winter of Antichriſts raigne and rage, after which we begin to ſee buddings of glory and liberty ſhine forth againe</p>

                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:118024:178"/>
Thirdly, Wee may apply this winter to the mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſhowring threats of the Law; and this I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand to be the right interpretation of the words; even as by the ſubſequent Spring, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be myſtically meant the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>Now looke how the winter is to the fruits of the earth, the ſame is the miniſtration of the Law to the ſoule.</p>
                     <p>The Law was promulgated with enſignes of feare, namely, with burning, <hi>fire, Blackneſſe, darkneſſe, and tempeſt: yea, ſo terrible was the ſlight, as Moſes ſaid, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly feare and tremble,</hi> Heb. 12. 18. 21. This ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie winter began with the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when Chriſt came in the fleſh to publiſh the Goſpell of joy and peace, the ſhowres of judgement ended: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſhowres were changed, from windie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſhowres, to refreſhing ſhowers of the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints under the Goſpell, are under a more glorious and comfortable diſpenſation, then the Saints were under the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that Chriſt uſeth this as an argument to quicken and ſtirre up his Church, to draw neere to him: namely, becauſe <hi>The winter was changed, and the raine gone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the nipping ceremoniall impediments were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and a greater diſcoverie of love and grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the New-covenant ſaith, <hi>Now that which is old, (meaning the Law) is ready to vaniſh away, Heb.</hi> 8. 13. that is, ſeeing Chriſt is come, and the time is now of the New-covenant, the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> ordinances (which he calleth in another place
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:118024:179"/>
carnal) and all the whole forme of the legall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ceremonies, formes of worſhip are abrogated. And now ſaith the Apoſtle, in Heb. 12. <hi>Wee are not come unto Mount Sinai, but unto Mount Sion,</hi> that is, to the Church under the Goſpell, whereof Mount <hi>Sion</hi> was a Type, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 7. Hence it is that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretelling of the glorie of the times of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſayth, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the laſt dayes, that the mountaine of the Lords houſe, ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the top of the mountains, and it ſhall be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the hils,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the ſpiritual glorie and grace of Chriſts Kingdome, ſhall be advanced above all worldly ſtate and power, and ſaith he, <hi>The Nations ſhall flow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and many people ſhall ſay, come ye, let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 2. 2, 3. that is, they ſhall embrane the wayes of Chriſt readily, and ſpontaneouſly, with a free ſpirit, they ſhall not be filled with that terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> that when they heard the words of the Law, deſired to heare them no more: but they ſhall ſay, <hi>He will teach us his wayes, and wee will walke in his pathes: for out of Zion ſhall goe forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem:</hi> That is, the doctrine of the Goſpell ſhall be firſt preached in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from thence ſent abroad into all the world.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt having uſed a motive to quicken his Church to come away, taken from the pleaſantneſſe of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to wit, the ſpring time.</p>

                     <hi>That the Spirit by a Goſpell miniſtration makes the Saints to abound in all fruitfullneſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us of the fruits of the Spirit, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance,</hi> &amp;c.

And Chriſt ſaith unto his Diſciples, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, in that yee bring forth much fruit,</hi> John 15.</p>

againe; contrary to the nature of other trees, who in their drineſſe ſwimme, and when they are thorow wet, then they ſinke to the bottome. Thus it is with the Saints, when they are firſt caſt into the water of affliction, they begin to ſinke, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when he walked upon the Sea with Chriſt: but when they have been long in affliction, and more exercitate, that have been as it were tried Soldiers, ſuch as have their ſenſes well <hi>exerciſed,</hi> or <hi>ſchool'd,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſuch I ſay, never will utterly ſinke in their trouble, but they can beare reproaches and perſecutions for Chriſts ſake, and when they are weake in themſelves, then they are ſtrong in him, and more then conquerours.</p>

                        </gap> reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> it will not ripen any otherwiſe, then only by <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 13. cap. 7.</note> ſcratching it with Iron hookes or rakes: and it being ſo ſcratcht, it will bring forth ſeven fold, ſaith <hi>Plinie.</hi> Such is our nature, that it will not bring forth any fruits unto righteouſneſſe; unleſſe it be quickned and ſtirred up by the Word and Spirit of God. Wee ſhall never be fruitfull trees in Chriſts Orchard, unleſſe we be pruned by the Father, unleſſe he purge us, and make us bring forth fruit, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Joh. 15.</hi> So much of the fig-tree: now followeth the ſimile of the Vine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Vine is good for no uſe, if it beare not fruit, for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> chap. 15. 1, 2. The Vine-tree is for his wood, leſſe regarded for building, then any Tree of the Forreſt, inſomuch as none will make a pin thereof to hang any Veſſel thereon, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt it into the fire and burne it. Wee may apply this to our ſelves; for what ſubſtantiall thing is in our
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:118024:184"/>
nature, that may be depended upon? he that makes any naturall abilitie, as a pin to depend on, will leane on a broken reed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Vine is very fruitfull, it brings forth abundance of grapes, as appeares, Pſal. 128. 3. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. 12. So the Saints are made exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by the flowings out of the Spirit of Chriſt upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Vines, and their fruit come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, except they be underproped and lift up from the earth: ſo it is with the Saints, both they and their fruits come to nothing, unleſſe Chriſt underprop them by his power, ſpirit, and grace: but being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped by the flagons of Chriſt, and by the diſtributions of his grace, they become very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>The Spring thus deſcribed: Firſt, figured by flowers and Birds ſinging.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the budding and ſprouting forth of the fig-tree and the Vine, wherein is ſet forh the gracious and pleaſant voice of Chriſt in the Goſpell, with all the effects and fruits thereof upon the Saints: Now it remaineth that wee ſpeake of the exhortation ſubjoyned.</p>

                     <p>This exhortation is the ſame, that wee had in the tenth verſe aforegoing, and therefore the leſſe may be ſaid of it now: only two things we may note from the iteration of this exhortation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It notes the backwardneſſe of our natures, and the untowardneſſe of our hearts, for yeilding unto

Chriſt: and therefore the Lord doth graciouſly call his people againe and againe to come up to a more full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It notes his exceeding great love, and rich mercie, that doth call us to ariſe from the evill wherein we lay captivated by ſinne, and from the winter blaſt of the Law, even from the curſe and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage thereof, and alſo he calleth us into the glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God: ſo that in all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and tentations, wee may come to him, and finde reſt, where wee may ſweetly enjoy our ſelves in him: all which is repreſented to us, by the flouriſhing and joyfull time of the Spring; which Chriſt uſeth as a motive, to perſwade us to come unto him.</p>

The exhortation is given forth unto us:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In a deſcription of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the thing exhorted unto.</p>
                  <p>The diſcription lieth</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In a ſweet and friendly compellation given by Chriſt unto his Church, <hi>My Dove.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In a deſcription of her dwelling place.</p>

                  <p>The thing exhorted unto, is the Churches manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of her ſelfe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this exhortation is drawne from the Churches excellent qualification, and this is laid down in a twofold aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>For thy voice is ſweet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he concludeth, <hi>And thy face is comely.</hi>

                  <p>As for the next exhortation in the 15. verſe you ſhall have the reſolution in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Now to the exhortation, and the parts thereof.</p>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>My Dove,! &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>Chriſt here calleth the Church a <hi>Dove;</hi> a title ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributed unto Chriſt himſelfe: the Holy-ghoſt ſometimes appeared on Chriſt in the ſhape of a Dove, to diſcover unto us thus much, that Chriſt ſhould have the propertie and diſpoſition of a <hi>Dove,</hi> as meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gentleneſſe, for indeed he became man for that end, to be a mercifull Saviour. <hi>I will not quench the ſmoaking ſtax, nor breake the bruiſed reed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. So that the mercifulneſſe of Chriſts nature,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:118024:186"/>
and the mercifulneſſe of his Office is ſet forth by the reſemblance of a Dove. Now as Chriſt had the Spirit in likeneſſe of a <hi>Dove:</hi> ſo all that are Chriſts, to wit, the Spouſe of Chriſt, have the diſpoſition of Chriſt: that ſpirit that framed Chriſt to be meeke, and gentle like a <hi>Dove,</hi> doth alſo frame the Church into the ſame likeneſſe and diſpoſition: hence he ſaith, <hi>My Dove, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerve hence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as Chriſts, ſo is the Churches temper and diſpoſition framed after the likeneſſe of a Dove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now wee muſt know, that there is ſome good in all the creatures: there is a beame of Gods majeſty, and an image of vertue, even in the inferiour creatures, wherefore the Scripture ſends us to ſuch creatures for many excellencies, that are to be found in them. Now the Church may well be compared to a <hi>Dove,</hi> and that for ſuch properties as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>Dove</hi> is a mournfull creature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I did mourne like a Dove, Iſa.</hi> 38. 14. And the <hi>Jewes</hi> are ſaid to <hi>mourne like Doves,</hi> Iſa. 59. and it is ſaid of thoſe that ſhould repent, that they ſhould mourne like <hi>Doves, Ezek.</hi> 7. 16. This was <hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. 5. <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourne in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech: that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The State of the Saints is like Doves, who mourne to God in their deſertions, afflictions, and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who heares the bemonings of his owne ſpirit in them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A <hi>Dove</hi> is an innocent, harmeleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; ſimple, without guile: hence the advice of Chriſt is to his Diſciples, <hi>Be innocent as Doves, Matth.</hi> 10. Now there is a ſimplicity that is ſinfull, when there is no mixture of wiſedome in it: for it is ſaid in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:118024:186"/>
                        <hi>Ephraim is like a ſilly Dove without heart, they call to Aegypt, they goe to Aſſyria:</hi> that is, when they did rely more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on friends, and outward helps, then upon God: But there is alſo a pure, holie ſimplicity, and ſo God is ſaid to be ſimple, becauſe there is nothing in him contrary to himſelfe, or to his owne nature. In this reſpect, the Church may be ſaid to be like the <hi>Dove,</hi> in reſpect of a good and holie ſimplicitie, when there is no no mixture of fraud, no duplicity in in the ſoule; <hi>A double hearted man is unconſtant, and unſtable in all his wayes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Dove is weake and impotent, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to help her ſelfe againſt the Birds of prey: it hath nothing but flight: So the Saints are unable to defend themſelves, but only they can flye to God as to their mountaine, and flye to Chriſt as to their Arke and ſtrength, for they have no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge then God, nor any hiding place beſides Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Dove</hi> is a very weake creature: Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that <hi>He ſhall tremble as the Dove, out of the Land of Aſſyria,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 11. So the Saints are called, <hi>The meeke of the earth, Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, And wee are exhorted by the Apoſtle, <hi>As the Elect of God, to put on the bowels of meekneſſe and compaſſion, &amp;c. Coloſ.</hi> 3. 12. Becauſe this grace diſpoſeth us to a neerer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God then other graces: it is a grace that God much delights in, and would have all his Saints adorned with, as is manifeſt in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. it is the beſt jewel or ornament, that the Saints can be adorned withall, becauſe it empties the ſoule of all fleſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and ſo makes it the more capacious to receive any good from God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:118024:187"/>
Fiftly, The <hi>Dove</hi> is loving, chaſt, and faithfull, to her mate, alwayes keeping cloſe unto her: So the Saints, they will not leave Chriſt to turne to Idols. It is reported that in the dayes of <hi>Julian,</hi> when Idols were ſet up in every corner of the Chriſtians Temples, yet then they made a ſhift to turne their eyes from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. The believing ſoule is faithfull to Chriſt, and will ſet up nothing in the heart above Chriſt,: <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and what is there in earth that I deſire beſides thee? Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. The Church is brought in like a chaſt virgine contracted, and her Members to be ſuch as follow the Lamb <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goes, for they have not defiled themſelves with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Revel.</hi> 14. 4. that is, thoſe that are chaſt to Chriſt, have not deſiled themſelves with idolatrie and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fornication.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Dove</hi> is a cleanely Bird, and it feeds cleanely upon pure graine, and will not lodge but in a cleanely place, where it may not be annoyed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unſavourie ſtentch, and the like: ſo it is with the faithfull ſoule, it will not feed upon the dung or dogs meat of this world, or on ſinfull pleaſures, but upon Chriſt and ſpirituall things. The carnall man uſeth to feed upon duſt, and earthly things, when as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule, that hath taſted the heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> it will not feed upon that which is baſe and earthly, neither can it indure to feed upon mens inventions or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legends, but it loves to feed upon the pure word of God, and upon heavenly and ſpiritual things.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Dove</hi> is a Bird that loves commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Who are thoſe that flock to the windowes like Doves,</hi> Iſa. 60. 8.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:118024:187"/>
C0<hi rend="sup">F</hi>or ſo they uſe to flock to their houſes by companies: So the Saints love to have fellowſhip with the Father, and the Sonne, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes, and alſo they love to have communion one with another. <hi>Doves</hi> will conſort with <hi>Doves:</hi> ſo will Saints have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Saints and none elſe.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, and laſtly, the <hi>Dove</hi> is a low priz'd crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as appeares by that allowance under the Law, that they who could not compaſſe a Lambe, might offer a paire of <hi>Turtle-Doves,</hi> and yet by the reaſon of the apparition of the ſpirit in the likeneſſe of a Dove, it is ſtamp'd with no ſmall worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: So the Saints are of very low eſteeme in the world, and lightly accounted of: but in regard of thoſe ſpirituall and divine appearances of God in their ſoules, they become of great worth, and excell in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencie; ſo ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his Neighbour, Prov.</hi> 12. 26.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have touched upon ſome properties of the Dove, unto which Chriſt doth reſemble his Church, and ſo farre of the loving attribute given by Chriſt to his Church, in ſaying, <hi>my Dove,</hi> &amp;c.

But we may underſtand this Rock myſtically to be meant of Chriſt, who is the Rock of the Churches ſalvation, as the Pſalmiſt often expreſſeth. Chriſt was typified by the Rock in the Wilderneſſe, as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. But for the <hi>clefts</hi> or <hi>holes</hi> of the Rock, they ſeeme to inſinuate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counſell of God ſealed up in Chriſt concerning the election and calling of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Gentiles</hi> did as it were, lodge in the eternall decree of God in Chriſt, all the time of the legall winter: The Apoſtle ſaith that God hath <hi>elected us in him before the Foundation of the World:</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle tells us in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>That we</hi> (meaning both Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile) <hi>were kept under the Law, and ſhut up unto the faith, which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</hi> So that the Church before her calling had her abode in Chriſt; yea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſecret ſtairs and lodgings of Chriſt.

The Lord tells <hi>Moſes, That no man can ſee his face, and live.</hi> We may ſee <hi>Jehovah's</hi> back-parts, but his face, that is, an immediate view of his abſoluteneſſe and perfection cannot be ſeene; and therefore he is called the <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God,</hi> but in Chriſt we have a manifeſtation of God, whereof we have a figure in <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33. The Lord proclaimed his mercy, his patience, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his truth, and juſtice before him, theſe are his back-parts, and more then theſe he could not ſee: and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord covered Moſes with his hand, while he paſſed by:</hi> But where was <hi>Moſes</hi> when he

Deut.</hi> 32. 31. Therefore it muſt not be the Vine of <hi>sodome,</hi> but the Vine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which wee are to underſtand here. This Vine is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and all the faithfull are labourers in the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>

                        <hi>That theſe enemies of the Spouſe, are of a devouring nature.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Firſt, for falſe Prophets, they are to be diſcovered, and refuſed of their errour, and after all, judg'd, and caſt out of the Church; he that will deny the doctrine of the Goſpell, wee muſt not receive him, neither bid him God-ſpeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> there is a mutuall intercourſe and viciſſitude of clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming intereſt betwixt Chriſt and his Church; the Church indeed glorieth in this, but not ſo much in her
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:118024:195"/>
ſelfe, as in her beloved, according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glorie in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 31. And obſerve what it is ſhe glorieth in, namely, in that communion which is betweene her and Chriſt, and this ſhee declareth by a paſſionate expreſſion of comfort, and that from the higheſt pitch of affection, from a heart enflamed with love, ſaying, <hi>I am my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds, and my beloved is mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Note from theſe words, <hi>My beloved is mine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That there is a union betweene Chriſt and his Saints, from whence ariſeth all ſweet communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is the head of his Spouſe, and ſhe by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit united unto him as his myſticall body: he is Chriſt the giver of all ſpirituall influence to his Church: Chriſt is alſo the Churches, as by marriage, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Husbands be the wives, his goods, and titles of honours are hers alſo, he having paſſed over the right of his owne body unto her: ſo is it in the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call marriage betweene Chriſt and the Spouſe, that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and conjunction of perſons betweene them, doth intitle the Church in the communion of all his graces.</p>
                  <p>Now from this union of perſons, comes a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all good things: ſo that the Church can ſay if Chriſt be mine, all that he hath is mine, what he hath done, and what he hath ſuffered is mine, and why? becauſe he is mine, for union is the foundation of all bleſſed communion. And ſo againe on the other ſide the Church can ſay, <hi>I am his,</hi> my perſon, my life, and ſtrength, and all is his, to glorifie him: ſo there is a union and communion mutually betweene Chriſt and his Church. The originall and ſpring hereof is Chriſts uniting and communicating himſelfe firſt to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:118024:195"/>
his Church, for the Spring begins to the ſtreame, what hath the ſtreame, but it firſt was in the Spring? Now there is an evidence of right and propriety that Chriſt doth communicate unto his Saints, whereby they have a comfortable intereſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In all his workes and performances, they are in a peculiar reſpect for every Saint, his making of the world, ſetling of policies and governments, rooting up of Kingdomes, executing of judgements in the earth, rewarding ſome, and puniſhing others, and the like, all theſe, and in all other generall providentiall workes of Chriſt, the Saints have a kinde of intereſt and proprietie in; next unto his owne glorie, Chriſt aimed at the good of his Church in all theſe things, and doth alwayes make them inſtrumentall for her welfare, in which ſenſe are the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>1 Cor. 3. 21, 22. All things are yours,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether Paul or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come; all is yours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Saints have a claime alſo in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and honours of Chriſt. There is a reciprocation (as it were) betweene him and his people; they are mutually and interchangeably glorified in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as Chriſt <hi>is glorified in them, Joh.</hi> 17. 10. ſo they are unſpeakably digniſied, and graced by him. <hi>The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Children</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are their Fathers, Prov.</hi> 17. 6. If the father be heroicall, or any way excellent, this is the Sonnes glorie, unleſſe he degenerate: now the Saints are called the <hi>Seed and the Children of Chriſt,</hi> whatſoever therefore he excels in, it is their dignitie, and their glorie: Beſides, Chriſt doth impart of his glorie and honour to them, making them like himſelf: Is Chriſt a ſonne, and heire of all? ſo are thy ſonnes,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:118024:196"/>
and heirs, and Co-heirs with Chriſt; ſhall he judge the World? So ſhall they in ſome ſort: Doth he breake in pieces the Nations with a rod of Iron? ſo doe they: is he aſcended into glory? ſo ſhall they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend: there is not any whit of his glory, unleſſe it be that which is utterly incommunicable, but they have a touch of it, if I may ſo ſay; yea, and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, redounds to their glory alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Saints have intereſt in the Offices of Chriſt. Every Saint may ſay of Chriſt, he is my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Teacher, he is my Prieſt and Reconciler, he is my King and Governour: yea, the Saints have ſuch an intereſt in theſe Offices of Chriſt, that vertue comes out of him to make them even Prophets, and Prieſts, and Kings alſo. Prophets in ſome meaſure, to teach themſelves and others, Prieſts to offer ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Chriſt; and Kings to rule over their owne luſts and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Saints have intereſt in the graces of Chriſt: he that hath the field hath alſo the treaſure that is hid in it. It was the greateſt conſolation and joy of the Spouſe that ſhee could ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine.</hi> So all that is in Chriſt a Believer may appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to himſelfe; he may ſay, his riches, his love, his goodneſſe, his greatneſſe, his power, and all that is his, is mine; I have intereſt in all thoſe tranſcendent graces of his, his mercy, his truth, his promiſes, they are all mine. Thus the Saints have a peculiarity and right in Chriſt, which is as the Spring of all mutuall love betweene them.</p>
                  <p>Now to joine the words together <hi>(My Beloved is mine and I am his)</hi> they imply,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:118024:196"/>
1. A mutuall intereſt; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and what is there in Earth in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thee?</hi> He is mine, yea, and I am his, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety with peculiarity and intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words imply a mutuall love; Chriſt is the object of the Saints beſt affections, and the Spouſe is the very Center of Chriſts love, his love reſts on the Church, and ſcatters not to other objects. Thus the Apoſtle applyes the love of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and gave himſelfe for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>And we love him becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 John 4. 19. So that the Church may ſay, Chriſt is mine, and his love is mine, and I am Chriſts, he hath my ſoule, my affections, and all that I have, is his, he hath my love to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The words doe alſo imply mutuall familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Chriſt is my familiar, my fellow-friend, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; he diſcovers himſelfe unto me in the ſecrets of his love: So the Saints have a ſpirit of fellowſhip and familiarity with God in Chriſt, ſo that they can unboſome and let open their hearts to him upon all occaſions, as unto a familiar.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, they imploy complacency or reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in the other. Chriſt hath a complacency and reſting in his Spouſe, he is well pleaſed in her, taking the greateſt ſatisfaction and content in her that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can be thought on. So the Church hath a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency or well-pleaſedneſſe in her beloved, whereby ſhee doth approve and like of all that is in him, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his goodneſſe, as in the moſt lovely and deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object in the World. Hence ſhee ſaith in Chap. 1. Verſe 1, 2. <hi>Thy love is better then Wine. Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Ointments powred forth, therefore doe
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:118024:197"/>
the Virgins love thee.</hi> This ſhews what a pleaſing and delightfull object Chriſt is to a believer: what more acceptable to the taſt then fragrant wine? Chriſt is far more acceptable to a Saint. What more pleaſing to the ſmell then ſweet Ointments of an exquiſite compoſition? Chriſt is the ſame, and far ſweeter to the heart of a believer, ſo that the Saints, from this complacency and wel-pleaſedneſſe in Chriſt, doe ſweetly acquieſce and reſt in him, as in the lovelieſt object in the world.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken of the union and communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Church, where was ſet forth the mutuall intereſt and owning between Chriſt and the Church. Now it will be neceſſary that I ſpeake ſomething of the order of this union. Chriſt is firſt ours, then we are his, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt is firſt ours, and then we are his becauſe he is ours.</hi> For this there are foure grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt is the well-ſpring of all grace in us, our grace comes from his grace, and our love from his love, as appears, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the leſſe is firſt beloved of the greater; the nature of love is firſt to diſcend, the ſuperiour firſt loves the inferiour; as the love of a Father diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to his Child firſt, then the Childs love aſcends back to the Father: So Chriſt firſt condiſcends to love us, then we aſcend in our love to him againe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the attractiveneſſe of Chriſts love <hi>Magnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris eſt amor:</hi> love is the attractive loadſtone of love: now our nature is ſuch, that we will love onely where we are firſt loved; as the heat of the Sun-beams reflect from a wall: ſo Chriſts love to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:118024:197"/>
us cannot but cauſe a reflexion of ours upon him; our love is but a ſparke of his. <hi>We loved him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales his love to us ſuch a fire muſt needs kindle and melt our affections, without which our hearts will be key-cold and frozen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt be the ſame ſpirit that tells our ſouls that Chriſt loves us, that muſt make us give up our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to Chriſt. The ſpirit of Chriſt doth ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplay before the ſoule, the rich, free, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall love of Chriſt, and alſo with the diſcovery of his love, cauſes the ſoul to love him againe.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be enquired into, is,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. How Chriſt comes to be ours.</item>
                     <item>2. How we come to be Chriſt's.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Chriſt becomes ours by ſuch means as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt is ours by the free donation and gift of the Father, as appears, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his onely begotten Sonne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt freely gave himſelfe unto us; ſo that Chriſt is ours by his owne conſent, he hath, as it were paſſed over himſelfe unto us. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved me and gave himſelfe for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. As the Father freely gave his Sonne unto us, ſo Chriſt freely and ſpontaneouſly gave his conſent to be ours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt hath paſſed himſelfe over unto his Church by Marriage; although we had nothing to bring to him but poverty and miſery, yet he tooke upon him our nature to diſcharge all, that he might marry us, and ſo paſſe over himſelfe unto us, as a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band paſſeth over himſelfe unto his wife. Hence it is that the Lord ſaith, <hi>I am married unto you, and I will take you one of a City, and two of a Family, and I will bring
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:118024:198"/>
you to Zion,</hi> Jeremiah, Chap. 3. Verſe 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Chriſt is ours by communicating o his owne Spirit to us: for the Spirit is given for thaf end, to ſhew us all things that are given us of God, whereof Chriſt is the chiefe: this is that the Apoſtle tells us, when he ſaith, <hi>No man knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God. Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God; and thus we have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Corinth. 2. 11. 12. 16.</p>
                  <p>Having declared how Chriſt is ours, and that he is ours in the firſt place, before we can be his. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that we ſpeak of the reflexion on the other hand, and ſhew how we become Chriſts.</p>
                  <p>The Saints are Chriſts theſe fowre wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath propriety in us by the donation of the Father. <hi>God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2. 36. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 22. And now ſaith Chriſt, behold, I and the Children whom <hi>thou haſt given me,</hi> Heb. 2. Thine they were, <hi>and thou gaveſt them to me,</hi> John 17. 6. For as in reſpect of Gods juſtice we were bought by Chriſt in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſo in regard of his love we were given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in our Election, that he might Redeeme us.</p>

                     <p>After the Church had extolled Chriſt for his love, ſhee praiſeth his feeding, affirming that to be <hi>among Lilies.</hi> Theſe words are diverſly Interpreted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Hebrew word may be taken either actively, or paſſively.

                        <hi>Lilies</hi> are ſuch kind of flowers as require a great deale of nouriſhment, and they flouriſh, and proſper
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:118024:199"/>
beſt in Valleys and low ground, where the ſoile is moſt fat, and therefore when ſhee ſaith, <hi>He feeds among Lilies,</hi> the meaning is, he feeds his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſweet, pleaſant, ſoft, and well-ſmelling pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, he plentifully and pleaſantly intreateth thoſe that are his; for Lilies we know are faire, ſweet, ſoft, and pleaſant, and therefore the Church ſaith, that her beloved ſeedeth his flock among the Lilies, which is to let us underſtand that he feedeth her with moſt excellent things. And it is moſt ſure, that there is nothing under Heaven that can be eſteemed as a full ſhadow and reſemblance of the Heavenly Manna, wherewith Chriſt feedeth the ſouls of his.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt feeds his Church and people fully, ſweetly, and comfortably. He feeds among Lilies.</hi> Agreeable to this is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) or my feeder, my Pastor,</hi> and what is the uſe he maketh of it? <hi>I ſhall not want:</hi> How is this made good? why ſaith he, <hi>He maketh me to lye downe in green paſtures,</hi> or <hi>in the budding graſſe.</hi> That is, in pleaſant paſtures where greene and tender Herbs doe ſpring, he makes me to lye downe and refreſh my ſelf. And he addeth, <hi>He leadeth me beſide the ſtill waters,</hi> or, <hi>he gently leadeth me unto the waters of reſt.</hi> That is, he doth comfortably guide me, with ſuſtaining my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, he nouriſheth me by the refreſhing waters of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The like place we have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepheard, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his Armes, and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> So Chriſt leads his people, as it were among Lilies, and feeds them plentifully,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:118024:199"/>
with ſweet and pleaſant things: and in his boſome he carries them, ſoftly, and tenderly, that ſuch as are weake may not be wronged.</p>
                     <p>Another place ſuitable to this purpoſe is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>I will feed them in good paſtures, upon the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Iſrael, there ſhall their fold be, there ſhall they lye in a good fold, in a fat paſture will I feed my flocke, and cauſe them to lye downe, ſaith the Lord God. I will ſeeke that which is loſt, and bring back that which is driven away. I will bind up that which is broken, and ſtrengthen that which is ſicke, and deſtroy the fat and the ſtrong, and feed them with judgement.</hi> Thus the Lord doth plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, comfortably, and ſweetly feed his people, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Lilies. Thus he feedeth us, and with us, he feedeth us as a Father, but feedeth with us as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo: yea, as an huſband and amiable lover. Now followeth the Churches prayer.</p>

                     <p>Now for the day, and departing of the ſhadows, we may underſtand it, of the time of the Law preceding
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:118024:200"/>
Chriſts incarnation, which Law was nothing elſe but a ſhadow of good things to come: Or, we may nnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the cloudy darke time in this world, and that after Chriſts appearing in the fleſh. I ſhall ſpeake a word to both theſe.</p>
                     <p>As Chriſt was the Sonne comming forth gloriouſly as a Bridegroom: So the Law was a ſhadow of good things to come, the bodie whereof was Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. wherein the Apoſtle may well allude to the ſhadow (accompanying a mans bodie) which ſometimes is before, ſometimes behind, as occaſion is miniſtred by the Suns courſe: even as ſhadows went before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, ſome other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after. And as the Apoſtle calleth all a ſhadow: ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> here uſeth the plurall, ſhadows, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all types and ſhadows.</p>
                     <p>Now for divine ſhadows, they may be conſidered as perſonall, or as ſacramentall.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For perſonall ſhadows; <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt, called the <hi>firſt man,</hi> being a ſhadow of Chriſt, called the ſecond man, or <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt in execution, but Chriſt firſt in intention: the firſt was but a type of the ſecond. The Second <hi>Henochs,</hi> whoſe name (in Engliſh, <hi>taught</hi> or <hi>dedicated)</hi> holds forth Chriſt, taught of the Father, and dedicated to his fathers will; and he <hi>increaſed in wiſedome and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whereby he was one with <hi>Henoch. Melchiſedech</hi> was another eminent type of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was firſt King of righteouſneſſe, and King of peace, ſhadowing forth him, who was the fountaine of all juſtice and righteouſneſſe, and the <hi>Prince of peace, Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Aaron,</hi> whoſe name ſignifieth a <hi>high mountaine:</hi> ſhadowed for Chriſt, who is ſet on <hi>the top of mountains and exalted
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:118024:201"/>
above the hils, Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. Thus I might ſhew how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Moſes, Joſhua, Samſon,</hi> with many other Prophets, Prieſts, Kings, and other of the men of God, they were all but types and ſhadows of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for ſacramentall ſhadows: as the ſacrifices ſhadowed forth Chriſts mediation for his people. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a type of the blood of Chriſt, without which blood is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. The ſtriking of the blood of the Lamb on the Poſts of the doors, where the Iſraelites dwelt was a token and aſſurance to them, that the deſtroying Angel ſhould paſſe over them, and ſmite only the firſt borne of the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> now what elſe did that blood preſigure, but the blood of Chriſt? wherewith the Saints being ſprinkled, the deſtroyer cannot hurt them. The Pillar of the cloud by day, and of fire by night was the type of Chriſt, leading and guiding his people continually. The water of the Rock, and the <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſſe were ſignes, that Chriſt ſhould ſpiritually feed and refreſh his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Serpent of braſſe lifted up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that he ſhould be their Phyſitian and healer. In a word, all the ſacrifices under the Law did typiſie, that Chriſt ſhould make attonement for believers.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe were darke, ſacramentall reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein God did appeare unto his people of old, therefore they deſired the neereſt approach of his unto them, untill theſe ceremoniall ſhadows ſhould vaniſh away.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the new Teſtaments ſhadows, they are baptiſme, and breaking of bread: and unto theſe two it was that the Ancients had reſpect, when as they ſaid, the ſide of Chriſt was pierced, that ſo the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:118024:201"/>
doore of life there might be ſet open, from whence the Churches ſacraments have iſſued; underſtanding by water, baptiſme; and by blood, the Lords ſupper. Now for theſe, they are but outward reſemblances, which lead unto Chriſt; ſo that when Chriſt which is our light ſhall appeare in the glorious diſcoveries of himſelfe, and as it were ſwallow up his people in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and glorie, then theſe ſhadows muſt alſo vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe when the truth it ſelfe appeareth, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and outward reſemblance muſt ceaſe: even as an Emperours image hath authoritie in his abſence, but being preſent, the Image hath no ſuch power: Therefore wee are to make uſe of the ſhadows, ſo farre as Chriſt is abſent from us: and againe, ſo farre as we have the ſubſtance, wee need not catch after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repreſentations and ſhadows. Thus much for the comming of Chriſt, declared by the time: <hi>

                     <p>Now followeth in the ſecond place the manner of his comming, by his ſwiftnes.</p>

                     <p>Of the <hi>Roe,</hi> and <hi>Hinde,</hi> wee have ſpoken of before in verſe 7. 9. But concerning the <hi>mountains of Bether</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be ſpoken.</p>

Now we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by theſe mountaines, myſtically to be the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wall, which divided betweene <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> untill the comming of Chriſt, who then of two were made one. Or elſe wee may underſtand the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of diviſion, by that ſin, or ignorance whereby wee are hindred from the full fruition of Jeſus Chriſt, for not only the Churches ſacramentall ſhadowes ſhall vaniſh; but alſo the night of ſinne, the workes of darkeneſſe, the ſcale of ignorance, and blindneſſe, and the ſhadow of death, ſhall flee away.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt Chapter of this ſong, we heard the fervent ſuit of the Church, for obtaining the preſence of her beloved, whereunto ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a comfortable anſwer. And after there was a
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:118024:204"/>
neerer communion betweene them, they fell into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall praiſes one of another.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Chapter, Chriſt provoketh his Church to make ſome returnes of his love, and this he doth, by ſpeaking excellent things of himſelfe, and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Spouſe. Whereupon the Spouſe is drawn forth to ſpeake excellent things of her beloved. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Chriſt in a moſt kinde manner ſought and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her up againe, and againe, to ariſe, and come forth unto him, to the end ſhe might have communion with him, untill all ſhadows were vaniſhed away.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Chapter the Church declareth, how ſhe ſought after her beloved, and how ſtudious ſhe was to find him, being abſent; as alſo for retaining of Chriſt being found: But after ſhe had found her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and was fully aſſured of his excellency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhe declareth that it is much better and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for her, not to ſtay her Spouſe here, but to aſcend with him into his heavenly bride-chamber.</p>
                  <p>This Chapter may be divided into two parts.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, the Church ſetteh forth the fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhe hath to take hold of Chriſt, and to poſſeſſe him, which appeareth in this, that ſhe ſeekes him by day, and by night, at home, and abroad, in the fields, and in the Citty, ſhe being wonderfully inflamed with his love, and this reacheth from verſe 1. to the end of the 5.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part, ſhe doth as it were correct herſelf, deſiring rather that he ſhould take hold of her, and that ſhe might abide with him, whereupon ſhe entereth into a commendation of his glorie, ſweetnes, &amp;c. And not only comparing it with <hi>Solomons,</hi> but preferring it before it, and that by many degrees, and this reacheth
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118024:204"/>
from Verſe 6. unto the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Churches ſearch after Jeſus is couched in the firſt three verſes. And in the firſt of theſe three is laid downe her firſt ſearch, together with the event.</p>
                  <p>This ſearch is declared from the circumſtances, which be two.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Of the time, and that was in the <hi>Night.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Of the place, and that was in her <hi>Bed.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>Laſtly, touching the effect of this ſearch of hers, it is not availing, for ſhee <hi>found him not.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>night</hi> is a time of ſolitary &amp; earneſt meditation, as in <hi>Iſa. 26. 9. With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night: yea, with my ſpirit within me, will I ſeeke thee early.</hi> And ſometime grievous afflictions are ſignified by the night, as appears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 3. &amp; 30. 5. 77. 2.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Bed</hi> ſome underſtand the Bed of eaſe and ſloath; and that the Church was now under deadneſſe and ſecurity, thinking that Chriſt had been preſent with her, when it was no ſuch matter. But this is not likely to be the meaning of the Bed, for what eaſe could the Church take in the abſence of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Bed ſometimes ſignifies tribulation, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 22. which may be implyed here, that the Church ſought and waited for the Lord in the way of his iudgements, as in <hi>Iſa. 26. 8. Yea, in the way of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments O Lord have we waited for thee, the deſire of our ſoule is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, we may take the Bed here for the place and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods worſhip, the Temple and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in Chap. 1. 16. where it is ſaid, <hi>Our Bed is green,</hi>
                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:118024:205"/>
meaning the place and means of bringing forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts unto Chriſt.</p>

It was the ſtrong affection of love, that ſet the Church on ſeeking Chriſt; ſhee could not indure his abſence, nor ſit downe contented without him. Thus the Church ſought Chriſt in his abſence: her ſucceſſe followeth, which for the preſent is <hi>non avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for ſhee ſaith,</p>
                  </div>

                     <head>But I found him not.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I found him not,</hi> towit, preſently, or I did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently perceive him, to be preſent with me, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my hearts deſire: I find not ſuch ſweet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his love, nor ſuch glorious apprehenſions of him, as my ſoul deſireth. This was the Churches ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe for the preſent. The verſe being thus opened; let us take notice of ſome Obſervations from it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt may ſometimes be abſent from his deareſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:118024:205"/>
Saints.</hi> This is implyed by the Churches ſeeking Chriſt, for inquiſition implyes abſence. Chriſt may, and doth many times vaile himſelfe for a time, and withdraw his light and comfort from the ſoule: but we muſt know alſo, that he takes not away his love, but onely ſuſpends the acts of it: he doth but ſeeme to frowne when he doth abſcond, and ecclipſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the ſoule, ſo that the ſoule looſeth the ſence of his love and favour, ſo that Chriſt ſeemeth to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abſent, or at a great diſtance from the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve, <hi>That when Chriſt is abſent from the Saints, they are in great unquietneſſe of mind, for want of the feeling of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> Hence the Church ſaith, ſhee ſought Chriſt upon the bed of tribulation and ſorrow, in the night of ſolitarineſſe and affliction: for when Chriſt is gone from a Believer in his apprehenſion, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſurance of his love is gone, joy and light is gone: O how dejected, how diſconſolate is the ſoul then! So far as a man is ſpirituall, the flame of love to Chriſt is kindled in him, and then he cannot ſit down without him. He is the Fountaine of all ſupply, he is the ſtaffe of ſtrength, the ſupport of joy, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life of the ſoule: O that I might ſee him (ſaith the Chriſtian) O that I might live in his preſence! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world will content him, neither honour, nor riches, nor pleaſures, nor friends, nor any thing elſe will content him, till he find the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Beloved, whom formerly with unſpeakable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he injoyed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve, <hi>That the Church makes earneſt inquiſition and dilligent ſearch after Chriſt when he is abſent. I ſought him,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:118024:206"/>
Shee ſeeks Chriſt with meditation, ſtudy, and ſtrong endeavours, ſhee ſeeks him diligently, as appears in the Verſes following, ſhee never gives off untill ſhee finds her beloved. All the Ordinances wherein ſhee ſeeks Chriſt are (as I may ſay) a walke wherein he meets his people: therefore the Saints put themſelves upon that way, but if they find not Chriſt preſent, their ſpirits faile, but when Chriſt is to be found by them, it is as life from the dead.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly Obſerve, <hi>That the principle from which a believer ſeeks Chriſt, is love. I ſought him whom my ſoule loveth.</hi> The love of iChriſt cannot be concealed: a man may ſooner keep in the wind with his fiſt, or ſtay the Ointment of his light hand from bewraying it ſelfe (as the Wiſe man peaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 16.): then not utter his love to Chriſt. Love is ſuch a fire as will break forth, it is the ſtrongeſt affection of the ſoule, and cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without the enjoyment of the thing beloved.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt is not always to be found in our ſence and feeling, though we uſe all good means to attaine it.</hi> This is from the Curches ſucceſſe in that ſhee ſaith, <hi>I found him not.</hi> Chriſt is not alwayes found on the ſuddain, he may a good while ſuſpend the acts of his love from a ſoule, to the end he may make it earneſt in ſeeking after him, and with endurance wait for his returne. and this effect we ſee in the following words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee perſiſts in her Narration, thus.</p>

                        <hi>That no repulſe or impediment can hinder the Saints from ſeeking after Chriſt.</hi> Here the Spouſe not finding Chriſt at one place ſeeks him in another; and if ſhee find him not at one time, ſhee ſeeks at another: ſhee ſought him on her Bed, and he was not found there; then ſhee renews her reſolution, ſaying, <hi>I will riſe now,</hi> and goe into the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Like the woman in the Goſpell, that would take no deniall; and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who would not let the Lord goe, untill he had got the bleſſing. The Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe thirſted for water, as the Spouſe here deſireth the company of her beloved: when <hi>Moſes</hi> had cryed to the Lord, he anſwered, <hi>Goe before the people, and take with thee the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Iſrael, and thy Rod, wherewith thou ſmoteſt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, take in thy hand and goe: Behold, I will ſtand before thee upon the Rock in Horeb, and thou ſhalt ſmite on the Rocke, and water ſhall come out of it, that the people may drinke.

                     <p>Theſe watchmen were imployed, and in action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſuch as went too and fro the Citie: ſo that whoſoever theſe watchmen were, it ſeemes they were vigilant and painfull in their generation, in ſo much that the Church ſaith, theſe watchmen found her.</p>

and humane helps faile, before he giveth comfort: as he ſuffered his Diſciples on the Seas to be almoſt drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, before he would help them, <hi>Matth</hi> 14. 26. Chriſt doth alſo many times worke without meanes, that the praiſe might not be aſcribed to men, but to himſelfe: <hi>As he gave Abraham a Child when he was old, and it ceaſed to be with Sarah, after the manner of women, Gen.</hi> 18. 12. So the Lord brought his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they were in mans judgement as farre from returning home againe, as the dead which were buried in their graves, yet then the Lord commanded <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie to the dead bones, ſhewing thereby, that the people ſhould riſe out of the grave of captivitie in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and returne againe unto <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezek.</hi> 37. And thus Chriſt did, when he was to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he lets him lie in the grave foure dayes, and then raiſes him to life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 39.

                     <p>The Church had ſought Chriſt with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and waited for him with much patience, and at length ſhe hath bleſſed ſucceſſe, and ſaith, <hi>I found him whom my ſoule loveth.</hi> A Father hath this ſaying, if not to day, yet to morrow; if not to morrow, yet the next day after it: as he which having fiſhed all the day caught nothing, and at night did thinke to give over, yet caſt his net againe, and caught the fiſh.

What is that ſtirred her up to ſeeke Chriſt ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently? and what was it that kindled her affections towards him, as to call him her <hi>beloved?</hi> ſurely it was Chriſt by his Spirit acting in her, and quickning up her affections: Chriſt had not ſo withdrawne, but he left the droppings of divine grace behinde him, he withdrew himſelfe in manifeſtation only, not in the realitie of workings of his Spirit: her heart was never ſo dead, but ſhe could ſeeke after her beloved, yea, and wait upon him, untill ſhe had freſh diſcoveries of his love manifeſted unto her.</p>

Chriſt.</hi> The Spouſe was not onely diligent in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her beloved, but ſhee had alſo a prudentiall care to keep Chriſt when found. <hi>I would not let him goe,</hi> ſaith the Church, ſhee came by him hardly, therefore ſhee will not part with him lightly; ſhee obtained him with much hazzard and danger, much loſſe and ſuffering, and therefore ſhee will not part with him for the greateſt advantage in the world. Shee knows nothing in this great and wide univerſe, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo lovely or deſirable, can be equivalent to ſuch a Jewell: ſhee knows that with him is the well-ſpring of life and all bleſſing; and therefore ſhee cannot be induced or perſwaded upon any termes to part with him. Many of Chriſts followers forſooke him, and went no more with him: but, <hi>will yee alſo forſake me,</hi> ſaith he to his Apoſtles? <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers for himſelfe, and the reſt, <hi>Lord whither ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life,</hi> John 6. 68. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Lord, if we leave thee, we leave our life and our comfort, we forſake our owne mercy: it was motive enough to ſtay by him, and to keep cloſe to him, to conſider that eternall life, and conſequently the very quinteſſence of all happineſſe was with him. The Merchant that found a treaſure of great price, <hi>went and hid it,</hi> and <hi>joyfully ſould all that he had</hi> to purchaſe it, and therefore he will not part with it for any good. The Merchant man is an Embleme or figure of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver, who when he hath found Chriſt, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe him by any means; no, but will ſay of him, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And on Earth there is none that I deſire in compariſon of thee. Chriſt is the ſtrength of his heart, and his portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25, 26. It is the voyce of the Church, <hi>The Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:118024:212"/>
ſaith the ſoule,</hi> not onely her tongue without, but even her ſoule and her Spirit within ſpeaks it with unconceiveable joy and delight, ſhee was in deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction when ſhee ſpake it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24. yet the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſuch a portion as the Lord, was ſolace and refreſhing enough to her. And <hi>David</hi> is in theſame mood too, <hi>The Lord is my portion and mine inheritance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>The lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 5, 6. He alludes to the manner of dividing the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was done by line. Now unſpeakable happy are all thoſe that have ſuch an heritage: can we thinke they will part with it? No verily, they will not ſo dote on any thing in the world as to leave heaven for earth, infinite and eternall joyes for a ſhort blaze, or a little flaſh of myrth: they will not part with ſuch an inheritance as Chriſt is, rich, fat, alwayes fruitfull, and never decaying. An inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance where there is no dirt, no winter or wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no dying or decaying of fruits, but ever green, ever flouriſhing, ever bearing, infinitly profitable and delightfull to the Poſſeſſors of it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, there is but one myſticall body of Chriſt, and one Spouſe: but always that part of the Church on Earth, is called the Daughter of the Church of former times: and Chriſtians doe beget Chriſtians and the new Church came forth of the old Church. Or, the whole Church is the Mother of each part, as in the uſuall phraſe of Hebrew ſpeech. Now of old, the Temple and Sanctuary might be the Chamber of her that conceived; that is, the place where they of the former Church did meet. So now <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, is called <hi>the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 3. which was figured by <hi>Sarah</hi> the free woman, and ſignifieth the Covenant of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. Now the houſe and Chamber wherein we are conceived, by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Covenant of grace, is outwardly the Church, but inwardly the heart where faith dwelleth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. Now into this houſe the Church ſaith ſhee will lead her beloved; we may take it eyther.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For her leading of him into the Church, and diſplaying of Chriſts goodneſſe manifeſted to her ſoul, to others. Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For her leading Chriſt down into her own ſoul; enlarging her owne affections by dilating upon the copious theme of his divine love, delighting in a cloſe and neer communion with him.</p>
                     <p>From the firſt of theſe Interpretations, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That he Saints having received conſolation from Chriſt,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:118024:213"/>
doe labour to make others partakers of the ſame comfort.</hi> Here the Spouſe having found her beloved, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his love and favour to her, ſaith, I will bring him into my Mothers houſe, towit, into the Church, and aſſembly of Saints, to ſpread all his goodneſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto me. Shee bringeth her beloved home, that ſo he may not onely dwell with her, but alſo be a ſolace to her Mothers Children; ſhee doth labour to communicate the comfort of Gods Spirit unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſo they may rejoyce with her. Thus <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> who finding <hi>Nathanael,</hi> did with much joy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the finding of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 45. Thus was the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who having found the Meſſiah, could not but caſt her Pitchar aſide, and goe into the City, to reveale that comfort to others, <hi>John</hi> 4. 28, 29. Nor can there be any ſoule that finds the ſweet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Chriſts love, but there is likewiſe a ſtrong deſire to acquaint others with their ſouls comfort. It is an eaſier thing to carry fire in the boſome, then to conceale ſpirituall comfort. <hi>We cannot</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but ſpeake the things which we have ſeene and heard,</hi> Acts 4. 20. As it doth much leſſen our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to conceale the thing we know, ſo it doth much increaſe and inlarge our comfort, to make known our injoyments to others.</p>
                     <p>From the ſecond Interpretation, towit, that the Spouſe entertaineth him to dwell in her heart: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it doth not content the Saints to have ſome ſlight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Chriſt, but they deſire to lead him into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chambers of their minds, that he may dwell in their hearts.</hi> So the Spouſe here had apprehended her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and ſhee doth not ſatisfie her ſelfe untill ſhee
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:118024:214"/>
hath led him downe into the inmoſt corner of her heart. Then it is that the Spouſe liveth, or Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in her, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. the Church is called upon by the holy Ghoſt <hi>to open the Gates, and everlaſting doors,</hi> (that is, the doors of their hearts) <hi>And</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>the King of glory ſhall come in,</hi> Pſal. 24. Shee doth open the gates and the doors and leadeth him in. What good thing can be wanting where the King of glory ſhall enter in to dwell? He is the Lord of Hoſts who is ſtrong and mighty in Battaile, who will ſubdue ſin, and put the Prince of darkneſſe to flight; yea, he will chaſe away all evill where he dwelleth. No marvaile then that the Church will not let him goe, but lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him into the Chambers of her that conceived her.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in that the Church is called the Mother of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>

                  <p>Theſe words being the ſame with the words in Chap. 2. 7. I ſhall not ſtand upon repetitions, but onely mind you of the occaſion of the repetition of them.</p>

                     <head>From the Wilderneſſe.</head>
                     <p>The <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi> of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was a figure of the world; as appeares in <hi>Ezek. 20. 35, 36. And I will bring you into the Wilderneſſe of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face, like as I pleaded with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the wilderneſſe of the Land of Aegypt, &amp;c.</hi> That is, as if the Lord had ſaid, I will drive you into the moſt ſolitary and ſavage places of the world, for a fulneſſe of miſerie.</p>
                     <p>Now this world may aptly be compared to a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe as it is commonly full of hurtfull and noyſome things, ſo is the world. Alſo we may apply it to the corrupt nature of man, and his miſerable eſtate thereby. In a Wilderneſſet here is not illing, no ſowing, no planting, no dreſſing; but all lyeth waſt, barren and deſolate: Even ſo it is with all man-kinde, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is nothing but barrenneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the World is like a Wilderneſſe.</hi>

                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:118024:217"/>
God planteth, tilleth and dreſſeth his Church, for ſhe is (as the Apoſtle ſaith) Gods huſbandrie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. ſhe is made fruitfull to the Lord: but the whole world beſide, out of which ſhe aſcendeth, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as a moſt deſolate and barren Wilderneſſe; there groweth in it not any good thing, nothing that hath ſweetneſſe or ſavour with it; but all noyſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavourie weeds grow there: A Wilderneſſe is cloathed with no beauty at al, it is no place of habitation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for wild beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it is a hard thing to leave the world with its vanities, and to lift up our mindes and affection unto heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So here the Church is taken up into admiration, for her leaving of the world, and aſcending upward, <hi>who is this that commeth out of the Wilderneſſe? &amp;c.</hi> that can forſake the world and luſts, to aſcend up unto me? as if Chriſt had ſaid ſo: when Chriſt came riding unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> all the Citie was moved ſaying, who is this? <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 10. The people admired him.

                     <p>The Pillars of ſmoake here mentioned, may be taken from the fierie pillar of the night, and the cloudy pillar of the day, by which the Iſraelites were condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through the Wilderneſſe, from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan:</hi> And in that it is ſaid <hi>Pillars of ſmoake</hi> meaning that the

                     <p>Againe, as ſmoake is darke, and hindreth the cleare ſight of any thing, as the cloudy pillar was darke to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Exod. 14. 20. ſo is the glorie and beauty of the Spouſe to the carnall eye, and ſhe is very obſcure to the world, becauſe of her afflictions in this life, which were reſembled unto <hi>Abraham</hi> by a <hi>ſmoaking Oven, Gen.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
                     <p>Or, laſtly, by <hi>Pillars of ſmoake</hi> may be meant the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie and holineſſe of the Spouſe: and then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is taken from the ſacrifice under the Law, of which the earthly matter was turned into aſhes, and the other part aſcended up in a flame of fire, as appears, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 16. 4. 12. 6 10. So the Spirituall ſacrifice of the Spouſe, aſcendeth up to God, on the Altar Chriſt, by the flaming fire of the Spirit, reſolving the earthly matter to aſhes remaining beneath, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſmoake aſcending up to God. Thus the Spouſe aſcends like Pillars of ſmoake: her qualification in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of odour and perfume followeth.</p>

And thus is the Church alſo made, through the interceſſion of Chriſt, to be ſweet and ſavourie, as it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal. 45.

                     <p>But I moſt of all thinke it is meant of the ſafety of the Saints reſting in Chriſt.

It appears by theſe words that King <hi>Solomon</hi> had every night threeſcore valiant men for his Guard, expert in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, that did keep the watch, that ſo he might ſleep in ſafety. Here is alſo mention made that they are the valiant of Iſrael, they were ſuch as might be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Now <hi>Solomons</hi> Bed was Guarded by theſe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby is figured that the Saints reſt free from danger and feare, in Chriſt.</p>

Tyrants breath out threatnings and terror, as if they would utterly deſtroy her, but having found her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhee finds reſt and peace in him. There can no enemy come neer the Spouſe to hurt her, neither can any evill come neer her. Hence it is, when Chriſt comforteth his Diſciples againſt the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that in me yee might have peace, in the world you ſhall have afflictions, but be of good comfort, for I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world,</hi> John 16. 33. then however the caſe ſtands with the Saints here in the world, they reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in Chriſt.

med of feeding together, and ſo participating each of others good or evill. This title Chriſt often giveth to his Spouſe in this Song, as in Chap. 1. 15. &amp; 2. 10. &amp; 5. 2. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The doubling of the word by an uſuall Hebraiſme, implyes, that ſhee was exceeding beautifull, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently glorious: it doth not onely ſet forth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of Chriſts affection and love towards his Spouſe, but alſo the excellency of the Church it ſelfe, in that Chriſt can, as it were, find no words ſufficient to expreſſe the ſame, her beauty being ſo great, both outward and inward, and alſo excellent in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. This beauty and fairneſſe of the Church hath been ſpoken of in Chap. 1. 15. therefore I ſhall ſpeake but briefly of it, onely ſomething to the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of repetition.</p>
                     <p>The Church was called forth in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to behold her Kings Coronation and Nuptialls, and here is prevented of an Objection which ſecretly might be made on her part. The Objection is this, <hi>Should I, one that am ſo poore and unworthy, come into the preſence of ſuch a ſtately King as Chriſt, who was typified by Solomon in reſpect of his glory?</hi> This Objection Chriſt takes away in ſaying, <hi>Behold thou art faire my love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints have a peerleſſe beauty and purity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them from Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of this beauty and grace they are the <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> (ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 2.) which comes downe from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for her huſband, and is free with her Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. into the communion whereof there can really enter <hi>no uncleane thing, neither whatſoever wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:118024:230"/>
abhomination or lies,</hi> Revel. 21. 27. By this grace the Saints are Temples of the holy Spirit, the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of God with men. The Spouſe of Chriſt is faire, and the faireſt; grace is a tranſcendent. good, all the excellency of civility and morality is nothing in compariſon of it. The Church is faire in her head Chriſt, being his myſticall body, and therefore is of a pure compoſition, made holy and gracious by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace.</p>
                     <p>It will be Objected, <hi>How can this be ſpoken of the Church here on Earth, in which condition even the beſt have great deformities?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, The Lord looks upon his Church not onely as ſhee is, but alſo as he meanes to make her hereafter, even all glorious and beautifull. Againe, he looks on her, not onely as ſhee is in her ſelfe, but as ſhee is in himſelfe, that is, waſhed and cleanſed from all impurity, and alſo decked with his glory. Thus we have the praiſe in generall: now it followeth to conſider of the praiſes in particular.</p>
                     <p>We have the praiſes of the Church in particular, by deſcribing a peerleſſe, or matchleſſe woman, from the face to the breaſt part. He mentioneth ſeaven particulars, the <hi>Eyes, Haire, Teeth, Lips, Temples, Neck,</hi> and <hi>Breaſt.</hi> The number of ſeaven, is often the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perfection, as appears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. where Chriſt is likened to a Lamb with <hi>ſeaven hornes, and ſeaven eyes, which are the ſeaven ſpirits of Grd.</hi> Now by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven parts thus enumerated, are meant the manifold and plentifull meaſure of graces beſtowed on the Saints, they being made <hi>partakers of all heavenly bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>

Hence Obſerve,</p>

                        <hi>That the Saints have a compleat and full ſupply of all grace and beauty from Chriſt.</hi> This is that for which the Apoſtle giveth thanks in behalfe of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> namely, <hi>that they were enriched by Chriſt, and came behind in no gift,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 5. 7. We muſt know, that all the Saints are knit together by one ſpirit, and doe make but one myſticall body in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. So then, as there be in the naturall body of a man, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Members, which according to their ſeverall gifts, have diverſe functions and operations: ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit aſcribeth the like to the myſticall body, as the Apoſtle ſheweth at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints are beautifull in all parts.</hi> Chriſt doth particularize every part, giving praiſe to every member. That beauty muſt needs be very rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, which ariſeth from the comelineſſe of all parts. If one part be comely, and another deformed, then there is no perfect beauty; but the Church juſtified and ſanctified in Chriſt, is glorious in all parts.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth the particular parts. The firſt and ſecond particulars doe lye in the following part of this verſe. The firſt uttering the ſtate of her <hi>Eyes,</hi> the ſecond ſhewing the condition of her <hi>Locks.</hi>

Faith is (as I may call it) a modeſt grace, and will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing to it ſelfe: and hence it is that the Lord declares ſo much affection to this grace of faith.

The Spouſe will not feed her Children with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions, and inventions of men, but with pure, divine truths, ſuch as ſhe hath received from Chriſt her head. In the Tabernacle was always the Candle burning, the Table of perfume ſenting, and the Shew-bread ſtanding before the Prieſt, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that in the Church, which is Gods houſe, ſhould alwayes be the light of Chriſt and his truth, and the bread of life diſpenſed unto the Saints.

                     <head>I will get me to the mountaines of myrrhe, and to the hill of frankincenſe.</head>
                     <p>What may be that mountain, and this hil? according to the letter, it muſt be ſuch a mountain as hath his name of myrr, and ſuch an hil as hath his denomination from incenſe, either becauſe there it was gathered, or elſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God; what mountaine in <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought forth myrrhe, is hardly knowne, except it were <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> which at firſt might be ſo called of the Hebrew word <hi>Mor,</hi> in engliſh <hi>myr,</hi> in Greeke <hi>Myrrhe.</hi> What hill is that that brought forth <hi>incenſe</hi> or <hi>frankincenſe,</hi> it is evident from many places, and even from this text, where the word tranſlated <hi>incenſe,</hi> is in the originall <hi>Lebonah,</hi> which may be termed <hi>Lebanon:</hi> ſo <hi>Moriah</hi> and <hi>Lebanon,</hi> may be the places here meant, according to the letter.</p>
                     <p>But according to the myſterie, <hi>Moriah</hi> may be both the one and and the other, becauſe the Temple was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Moriah, 2 Chron.</hi> 3. 1. and there myrrhe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſ ewere dayly offered up to the Lord.

Now if we take the words for the litterall Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> with all the myſticall adjuncts of divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, namely, from the odours dayly burned there, then we may underſtand <hi>Meſſiahs</hi> ſpeech better in more words thus: <hi>O my beloved Spouſe, thou longeſt to ſee my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the fleſh: ſatisfie thy ſelfe for a ſeaſon, for in the fulneſſe of time thou ſhalt ſee me, but till a certaine time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of my Father, that muſt not be. In the meane time I will walke under types and ſhadows, under Moſaicall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and ſpiritually make my reſidence at Jeruſalem, where ſweet odours are continually burned, and offered up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, If wee take it for the ſpirituall Temple, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, the Saints under the new-Teſtament, who are the houſe of God and Temple of his Spirit: then Chriſts ſpeech may be thus reſolved: <hi>Sweet Spouſe, thou art willing to looſe my bodily preſence, for it is appointed of my Father, that I goe unto him, and ye ſhall ſee me no more, but the comforter ſhall come, and teach you all things, bring all things to your remembrance, and lead you into all truth: and though I am abſent in reſpect of my humane nature, yet I will alwayes be preſent in my divine nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, take the ſpeech of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the auncient Church before Chriſt, longing after his incarnation; or take it to be his Speech to the Church under the Goſpel ſince the aſſumption of our fleſh, they yeild us this obſervation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt was ſeen ſpiritually, by his people of old under the loweſt diſpenſation, under legall types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, under oblations and ſacrifices of burnt offerings. The Lord appeared to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Tabernacle
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:118024:242"/>
in the Wilderneſſe, which was made by the direction of God given to <hi>Moſes.</hi> This was a type.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of Chriſt, who is ſaid to pitch his Tabernacle among us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, The Church is called the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 3. The Lord went out of his Tabernacle into the Temple, which was built accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of God given to <hi>Solomon.</hi> This was a type of Chriſts body, as appeares by his owne words, <hi>deſtroy this Temple,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo the Church is called <hi>The Temple of the Lord, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 21. After this the Lord appeared in the miniſtrie of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was Chriſts fore runner to prepare the way, he came baptiſing with water, which baptiſme had a neer reſemblance to the legall waſhings under his Law. But after all this God appeares in his Sonne, in whom all fulneſſe was, as appeares, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. Chriſt was full of the divine annointings of the Father. Now when Chriſt was to goe out of the world, he makes a ſupply of his corporall abſence, by returne of his Spirit, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I wil come to you. When the world ſeeth me not, yet ye ſee me.</hi> This noteth the preſence of Chriſt by his Spirit with his Church: but there is more then a preſence, there is an inhabitation. <hi>At that time you ſhall know, that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you, Joh.</hi> 14. 18. 20. This is the moſt glorious manifeſtation of Chriſt, namely, in the ſpirituall diſcoveries of himſelfe unto his Saints. I intend not to enlarge on theſe things but proceed to the next words.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe words wee have another commendation of the Churches beautie: ſo that though Chriſt did not name all particular parts of his Spouſe, to give them their ſeverall commendation, as he did in divers, yet he aſcribeth a full perfection of beautie unto them all, when he ſaith, <hi>Thouart all faire, &amp;c.</hi>

By theſe ſpots here mentioned, wee may underſtand them of any ſinfull worke, or greater ſort of ſinnes, and by wrinkle, leſſer ſinnes, and thoſe infirmitie, which are ſome blemiſh to our ſpirituall beautie: So that Chriſt cleanſeth his people from all ſinne, according as it is ſaid, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.

thoſe places of Scripture, which teſtifie ſo plainly, that all the Saints while they live here, be full of ſpots and deformities?

By this the Spirit would have us underſtand, that Chriſt ſhould gather his people from all the Quarters of the world, and they ſhould behold his glory.

However the Spouſe may be ſcattered among the Nations of the world, yet he will take her unto himſelfe; for he will gather his elect from the fowre winds, and from the uttermoſt parts of the Earth. Thus the Lord promiſeth to bring the ſeed of his Spouſe <hi>from the Eaſt, and gather it from the weſt: And he will ſay to the North give up, and to the South keep not back: bring my Sonnes from farre, and my Daughters from the end of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 43. 5, 6.

                  <p>Chriſts ſingular love to his Church, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares with a marvailous earneſt affection, is ſet forth with grave and weighty exclamations.</p>

                     <p>Such repetitions as theſe imply in the Hebrew phraſe a ſuperlative excellency, and hereby is ſet forth how exceedingly Chriſts heart and affections were overcome with the love of his Spouſe. It is the manner of the Hebrews to repeate the ſame things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in prayers, to manifeſt the zeale of him that prayeth, as where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Matth. 26.

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:118024:247"/>
to confirme and aſſure mens hearts that the matter is true.</p>
                     <p>This phraſe doth admit of diverſe readings. Some read it, <hi>Thou haſt ſnacht or taken away my heart,</hi> as it were, by violence and force.

                        </note> and delightfull drawing of the heart by love. I cannot expreſſe it neerer the Originall word, then to ſay, <hi>Thou haſt unhearted me,</hi> that is in effect thus, <hi>Thou haſt wounded,</hi> or, <hi>taken away my heart from me,</hi> thou haſt even raviſhed and overcome me with thy love. Chriſt ſpeaketh here to his Spouſe as a man overcome with love, for it doth exceedingly ſet forth the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love when the Bridegroome ſhall tell his Bride that ſhee hath gotten away his heart. Hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the ſuper-abounding love of Chriſt towards his Spouſe, in that there be not any words ſufficient fully to expreſſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts heart and affections are exceedingly taken with his people.</hi> Hence it is ſaid that the <hi>Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over his people as the Bridegroome rejoyceth over the Bride,</hi> Iſa. 62. 5. Like unto this is that where the Lord ſaith in <hi>Zeph. 3. 17. The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty, he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging:</hi> That is, he will reſt well-pleaſed, and much delighted in his love, and he will rejoyce over his Spouſe with the higheſt pitch of joy; yea, he will rejoyce with ſinging, which is the higheſt expreſſion of joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:118024:248"/>
So then, the heart of Chriſt being thus taken, is meant his exceeding love whereby he rejoyceth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his people, according as it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa. 43. 4. Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus Chriſt hath declared how neer and deare his Spouſe is unto him, by the ſimpathy of like mind and affection, which is betweene him and his Church. Now it followeth, that he ſhews how neerly they are related one to the other, by the band and conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and conjugall amity.</p>

So that Chriſt tooke our nature, and was cloathed with our fleſh, to be made like unto us his brethren, and in the ſame fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond right is of adoption; for it is ſaid, <hi>when
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:118024:248"/>

                     <p>By the lips of the Spouſe, is meant her ſpeech, both private and publique, whereby ſhee uttereth moſt ſweet and delightfull words, to wit, of faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſuch words of preaching his doctrines, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his praiſes are as pleaſing to Chriſts eares, as the honey-comb it ſelfe is pleaſant to the taſt. And he putteth the lips which are ſome of the inſtruments wherewith a naturall voice is framed, and words are uttered, for the ſpeech it ſelfe, or things ſpoken. By this ſimilitude of the honey-combe, the word of God is praiſed, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. where it is ſaid, that

the judgements of the Lord <hi>are ſweeter then the Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, or the droppings of the Honey-comb:</hi> that is, that which commeth forth without preſſing, and is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſweeteſt and pureſt honey.

                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>

The language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is a pure language, and lips that are pure drop forth pure words. When the heart is cleane, the mouth ſpeaketh pure things. Where there are lying, ſlandrous words, taunts, and revilings, and much vaine babling, theſe proceed from the evill treaſure in mans heart. But they whoſe lips drop as the Honey-combs, have their <hi>Speech alwayes gracious, powdered with ſalt, to know how to anſwer every man,</hi> Colloſ. 4. 6. <hi>Even ſuch as miniſter grace to the hearers,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 29. <hi>As grace was powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lips of Chriſt,</hi> Pſal. 45. 2. So by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his grace, the ſpeech of his people is made gracious. The Prophet complained, <hi>That he was a man of polluted lips, then the Seraphin flew unto him with a hot coale in his hand, which he had taken from the Altar with the Tongs, and touched his mouth, and ſaid, lo this hath touched thy lips, thine inquity ſhall be taken away, and thy ſin purged.</hi> Iſa. 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>All our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. And therefore all holy ſpeech proceedeth from him, for <hi>none can ſay Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Lord, but by the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 1. But

                        <hi>Honey and milke</hi> are for nouriſhment; it is ſaid of Chriſt in his Child-hood, <hi>Butter and Honey ſhall he eate, untill he have knowledge to refuſe evill and doe good,</hi> Iſa. 7. 15. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called in ſundry places of the Scripture, a Land that floweth with Milke and Honey meaning that it had abundance of all things, profitable and pleaſant for this life; underſtanding by <hi>Milke</hi> things of neceſſary and profitable uſe, and by <hi>Honey</hi> things of pleaſure and delight, and ſo the holy Spirit here doth meane, the ſweet, comfortable, and nouriſhing words of faith, love, and the like. Alſo we may underſtand fit food for all ſorts of Chriſtians, both for ſtrong ones and weake ones. <hi>Milke</hi> moſt properly belongeth to children, as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. And Honey to them of more ſtrength, as examples of the Scripture, and reaſon it ſelfe teacheth in <hi>Jonathan, Sauls</hi> Sonne, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 27. And in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Mat. 3. 4. Thus it pleaſeth God in the Scripture to compare the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which proceeds out of the mouth of the Spouſe to Milke, to Honey, to Wine, to Water, and many ſuch like things. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>under the tongue,</hi> ſeemeth to be meant the ſecret and inward parts, as the mind and heart. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is ſaid to <hi>exalt God under his tongue,</hi> Pſal. 66. 17. declaring his uprightneſſe and ſincerity thereby. It is ſaid in <hi>Prov. 5. 3. The lips of a ſtrange woman drop as an Honey-Comb, and her mouth is more ſmooth then Oyle.</hi> Now
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:118024:253"/>
by this ſhee is ſaid to intice men to folly, and as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next verſe, <hi>The end of her is bitter as worme wood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword her feet goe downe to death,</hi> &amp;c. And the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>ſome by good words and faire ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> Rom. 16. 18. And the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh thus, <hi>The words of his mouth were ſweeter then Butter, but war was in his heart: his words were ſofter then Oyle, yet were they drawne Swords,</hi> Pſal. 55. 21. And <hi>Adders poyſon is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lips,</hi> Pſal. 140. 3. Of the wicked it is ſaid, <hi>Their throat is an open Sepulcher, they have uſed their tongues to deceit, the poiſon of Aſpes is under their lips, their mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe.</hi> By theſe ſpeeches are meant the deceitfullneſſe of the wicked. So on the contrary, when it is ſaid, <hi>Honey and milke are under her lips,</hi> it is meant of the ſincerity of her graces. So that the words of faith and holineſſe, which proceed from ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart, are very comfortable and nouriſhing words.</p>

That is, the word of the Spirit, given out by the Saints. The plenty of grace in the times of the Goſpell is promiſed under the ſimily of <hi>abundanee of milke,</hi> and that every one ſhould eat <hi>butter and honey,</hi> Iſa. 7. 22.

He was caſt forth from the marriage that wanted the wedding Garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. for the Garments of the Bride are ſweet, even as the ſavour of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> where pleaſant and odouriferous Trees, Herbs, and Spices grew in abundance. The Garments of <hi>Zion</hi> are called <hi>beautifull,</hi> Iſa. 52. 1.

The aptneſſe of the Church to bring forth fruits, as are mentioned in the next verſes, is ſet forth by two ſimilitudes, both which ſet forth her praiſe.</p>

                  <p>The firſt compariſon ſets forth the praiſe of the Spouſe. 1. In her ſafe protection in Chriſt. 2. Her faithfullneſſe and chaſtity to him, for ſhe is as a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den incloſed.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, ſhee is highly extolled in that Chriſt is as a ſpring of living waters unto her, and ſhe alone partaketh of his heavenly treaſures.

                     <p n="1">1. The Garden is ſevered from all the reſt of the ground, from the field and from the wilderneſſe. So the Saints are ſevered to be elect veſſells of honour, from the other Clay which is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And which is more, he was ſeparated from his Mothers womb, and called him by his grace to receive his Sonne in him, <hi>Gallath.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a Garden are all manner of pleaſant and wholſome Hearbs and Trees growing: So in the Church are all manner of uſefull ſpirits ſpringing up as the Trees of righteouſneſſe, to the praiſe of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Garden is a place of pleaſure where men uſe to refreſh themſelves, and take pleaſure to walke in. So Chriſt taketh pleaſure in his Church, where he ſaith, <hi>Thou art all faire,</hi> &amp;c. yea, Chriſt doth walk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully in this Garden, and calleth his friends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to walke with him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In a Garden is abundance of paines taken, to plant and dreſſe, and the like. So Chriſt worketh in his Garden, where he ſaith, <hi>Know yee not that I muſt goe about my Fathers buſineſſe,</hi> Luke 2: 49 He ſaith, he hath finiſhed the worke which the Father gave him to doe, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4. And <hi>what could I have done more for my Vineyard, which I have not done.</hi>

plants, as God planted <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Maſter of the Vineyard did the like in his Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 1. 80 that the Trees of the Garden grow not naturally, as thoſe in the Wilderneſſe, which beare no fruit, but are planted by the labour of the husband-man. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The juſt man ſhall be like a Tree planted by the water ſide, which ſhall bring forth his fruit in due ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 1. 3. All the Frees in Chriſts Vineyard are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, as Chriſt faith, <hi>Every plant which my Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up,</hi> Mat. 15. 13.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. All plants in a Garden are not of one kind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they bring forth the ſame fruits, but diverſe according to their kind: So in the Church, the whole body is but one, but it hath many members, &amp; all of the ſame body, which is one: now all theſe members have ſeverall operations and functions: and the members muſt have the ſame care one of another, as the Apoſtle treateth on at large, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. The Church as a Garden is incloſed for diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-ſake,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:118024:256"/>
becauſe it is ſeparated from all other people, as a Garden is ſeparated from the wilderneſſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon field. As the light was ſeparated from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Creation of the world, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were ſeparated from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the partition-wall, and the moſt holy place from the Sanctuary, by the veile of the Temple: So the Lord hath ſeparated and choſen his people from among all Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues, foraſmuch as this foundation remaineth ſure, <hi>the Lord knows who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. And as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and the way of the wicked ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 1. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Garden is incloſed alſo for defence, God hedgeth it on every ſide that the wild Boare may doe it no hurt. For walls, doors, locks and bars, are means of defence and ſafety: thus <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>locks,</hi> and <hi>Bars,</hi> Nehem. 3. 3. 13. And when ſuch fences are wanting, all things lye to the ſpoile, as in <hi>Iſa. 5. 5. Pſal.</hi> 80. 12. Thus the Lord maketh his Church as a Towne walled about for defence againſt the enemies, that it cannot be conquered; as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was compaſſed about with hills. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be moved, but ſtandeth for ever: the hills compaſſe Jeruſalem round about, ſo is the Lord round about his people, from henceforth, for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 125. 1, 2. It is built upon a rock, <hi>that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. And God hath promiſed to be <hi>a wall of fire round about Jeruſalem.</hi> Zech. 2. 5.

he hath it for his owne uſe. Here is noted the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spouſe, ſhe goeth not a whoring after other Gods, ſhe is not like the <hi>Harlot which ſitteth at the doore, and calleth to her the commers by, and ſaith, ſtollen water is ſweet,</hi> Prov. 9. 17. But the Spouſe of Chriſt is carefull to keep her ſelfe and all her plants and fruits holy, chaſt, pure unto her beloved onely: <hi>ſhee openeth the gates that the righteous Nation may enter in, which keepeth the truth</hi> Iſa. 26. 2. But ſhee labours to withſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the uncleane and abhominable, that it enter not in, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 27.

Springs and fountaines are never dry, but ſend forth ſtreams of water continually. So that this ſignifieth the abundance of waters that the Church is ſupplyed with, it is as a Spring able to water all parts of the Garden.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the garden of Chriſts Church is plentifully watered by his ſpirit and grace, and ſo made fruitfull.</hi> This gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is therefore well watered, there is a ſpring of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, which alwayes doe flow, wherewith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very herb and pretious plant is watered. Thus Chriſt himſelfe teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water,</hi> John 7. 38. And when the Lord promiſeth a full ſupply of his Spirit, he ſaith, <hi>I will powre water upon the dry ground, and floods upon him that is thirſty,</hi> Iſa. 44. 3. This water fructifieth the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, molifieth the hardneſſe, and cooleth the hot diſtempers, and moiſtneth the drineſſe of the hearts of the Saints, and ſo makes them fruitfull Trees of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to Gods praiſe. Water is comfortable to a thirſty land; ſo is the ſupply of the Spirit to a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſoule, hence ſaith <hi>David, My ſoule gaſpeth after thee as a thirſty land,</hi> Pſal. 143. 6.

Intimating, that the <hi>South</hi> parts of the world thirſted after water in a dry Summer. Such is the joy of the dry and thirſty ſoule, when God cauſes his ſpirit to returne upon it, and refreſh it with heavenly ſupplies. It is promiſed, the Lord <hi>will ſatisfie thy ſoule in droughts, and make fat thy Bones, and thou ſhalt be like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe waters faile not,</hi> Iſa. 58. 11.

                     <p>Secondly, note.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That this Spring and fountaine of living water is only to refreſh the Spouſe.</hi>

Theſe waters, although they abound, yet they flow not forth of the garden, they be ſhut up and ſealed, none other garden or plants are watered by them. Now ſome may object, that the doctrine of the Goſpell is publiſhed to all promiſcuouſly, how is it then a fountaine ſealed up? I anſwer, that the word doth in a ſort flow forth to all, which are not the true plants of the Lord; but it doth not water them, they have not lively, ſpirituall, and effectuall working of it, to make them grow and beare fruit. It is with them, as water falling upon a Rock, which doth only wet the out-ſide and not ſoften the rock or ſtone within, So that though the outward, litterall, and hiſtoricall part of the word be common to many, yet the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall part, and the lively efficacie thereof, is peculiar to the Spouſe alone: She only is refreſhed with theſe fountains of living water, her plants be watered all with them, and made fruitful. Thirdly Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Spouſe is chast unto Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She will bring forth fruit only unto him, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no plants but her owne: when <hi>Solomon</hi> would teach ſpirituall chaſtitie, he doth thus expreſſe it: <hi>Drinke water out of thine owne Ciſterne, and running waters out of thine owne well: let thy fountaines be diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and rivers of water in the ſtreets: let them be only thine owne, and not ſtrangers with thee: let thy fountaine be bleſſed, and rejoyce with the Wife of thy, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 5. 15. 18. Thus the Spouſe here is a fountaine <hi>ſealed up,</hi> ſhe is not for ſtrangers and ſuch as paſſe by, her care is to keepe her ſelfe holie, pure, and chaſt unto her beloved, ſhe watereth only her owne plants, ſhe keepeth watch, leaſt any uncleane thing ſhould enter, ſhe openeth her gates, that only <hi>the righteous Nation may enter in,</hi> as it is
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:118024:259"/>
in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 2. Thus we have the Spouſe ſet forth as a well watered garden apt to beare fruit: now what ſtore of all ſorts of precious fruits ſhe brought forth, the two next verſes doe ſhew, for here are reckoned up all manner of the beſt plants.</p>

                     <p>This ſeemeth to be the ſpeech of the Spouſe unto Chriſt, <hi>O thou fountaine, &amp;c.</hi> Now whereas the Lord had commended the Spouſe in the former verſe, to be a ſweet garden, ſo well watered, and of ſuch precious plants: ſhe now aſcribeth all the praiſe thereof unto him, as if ſhe had ſaid thus: I humbly acknowledge the things to be in me, that thou haſt ſaid, howbeit I confeſſe, that they are not of my ſelfe, but from thee, the fountaine of all good things, and though that I do performe the dutie of a fountaine towards mine, yet thou art he, to whom indeed the name of fountaine and living waters, yea of life it ſelfe doth only apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: yea, thou art the only fountaine, and I doe but water others as from thee, <hi>O fountaine of gardens,</hi> &amp;c. It is from the fonntaine, that all the Rivers flow, (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 10.) which water the gardens and plants in them, ſo making them greene and fruitfull. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpeaking of the glorie of <hi>Aſſiria,</hi> comparing him to the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> with faire branches, ſaith <hi>The waters made him great; the deep ſet him on high, with her rivers running about his plants, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 31. 4, 5.
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:118024:263"/>
And ſo when deſolation is threatned to the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> it is likened to a <hi>garden that hath no water, Iſa.</hi> 1. 30. It is to be noted alſo, that the univerſall Church is but one garden, and all the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be gardens, ſo that her ſpeech and his doe not differ, when he calleth her a garden, and ſhe calleth him a fountaine of gardens, when he calleth her a fountaine ſealed up, which doth water all the plants, ſhee doth acknowledge the truth thereof unto his praiſe, affirming that he is the fountain of the gardens: that is, looke whatſoever waters of life be in her, yea, in all particular Churches, they flow from him, he is the fountaine.</p>

                        <hi>That Chriſt is an overflowing fountaine of living water, refreſhing the garden of his Church, with ſtreames of his fulneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Spouſe doth acknowledge all her ſupplies from him, in one word, when ſhe calleth him, <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of gardens. It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all falneſſe dwell, Col. 1. 19. And in him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the God-head bodily, Col. 2. 9. Now of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace, Joh. 1. 16 And he he is made unto us of God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Chriſt by his Spirit doth refreſh his Churches, and all their plants, ſatisfieth their ſoule in drought, and maketh fat their bones: that their ſoule is <hi>Like a watered garden, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all, Jer.</hi> 31. 12.

Chriſt is an everlaſting ſpring, alwayes ſending forth waters of life to refreſh his Saints: the ſupply that he gives is conſtant: 'tis not like a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bourne, that failes, and dries up in the Summer: but like an ever ſpringing fountaine, whoſe ſtreames are never drie.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt hath the command of all creatures.</hi> He calls for the <hi>winds</hi> out of his treaſures when he pleaſes, and
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:118024:266"/>
reſtraineth them againe at his will. This drew the Diſciples in admiration to ſay, <hi>What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the Seas obey him?</hi> Mat. 8. 27.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we ſee here, that Chriſt ſpeaks to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winds, both in reſpect of their quality and quarters from whence they blow.</p>
                     <p>Hence Note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt can bring good things to his Church by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A cold nipping North wind, and a pleaſant cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing South wind, may both be ſuitable for the Garden of Chriſt. The Spouſe may ſometimes ſtand in need of purging, and ſometimes of cheriſhing, from whence it is the ſpirit of God carries it ſelfe ſuitable to both conditions: and the Saints may be ſure, that all the winds blow them good. Thus we have the Apoſtle teſtifying, <hi>That all things worke together for good to us that love God,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. And <hi>that all things are ours, Paul, Apollo, Cephas, things preſent, and to come, life, death, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 21.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Spouſe deſires the heavenly breathing of Chriſts ſpirit to come upon her.</hi> It is not the North wind, and the South wind which blow upon the Trees, and that are felt of our bodies, that are meant here, which blow upon theſe heavenly plants: but it is an heavenly breathing which ſhe here requireth, even the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit God, which is called the ſpirit of Sanctification, the ſpirit of adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this Spirit of God may well be reſembled to wind, and that in ſuch reſpects as theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The nature of the wind is to <hi>blow where it liſteth,</hi>
                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:118024:266"/>
John 3. 8. So the Spirit of the Lord blows freely, and opens the heart, powring in abundance of grace: it doth awaken and draw forth all the affections to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The wind is of a prevailing force, it beats downe all before it: ſo the Spirit is mighty in operation, it brings downe high Mountaines and hills, that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted againſt Chriſt, and layes them levell: no man can prevaile againſt the ſpirit of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man receives his breath and life naturally from the aire, a man cannot live without wind: no more can a regenerate man live without the ſpirit of God: for by the breathings of the ſpirit the ſoule of a Chriſtian lives.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The wind is of a cooling nature: ſo the ſpirit doth coole the hot diſtempers in the ſoule; allaying all unnaturall heats, and bringeth the ſoule into a good frame and temper.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The wind is of a cleanſing nature, it purgeth the aire and the water, and keepeth them from infections: So the ſpirit of God purgeth the heart from dead works, to ſerve the living God in newneſſe of life.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The wind hath a cheriſhing, and a fructifying force with it: ſo the Spirit quickneth and cheriſheth the ſoule, it makes the heart that was as a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, to become a fruitfull Garden.</p>
                     <p>For theſe reſpects and the like, the ſweet gale of the ſpirit is compared to <hi>wind.</hi> Hence it is, that the Spouſe deſireth that the winds may</p>

God doth plant it, viſite, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and water it, yea, he takes pleaſure in his Spouſe, as in his pleaſant Garden. But I ſhall not ſtand on this point, becauſe it was largely treated on in Verſe 12. of this Chapter. But I ſhall proceed to the reaſon or ground of this requeſt, which is as followeth.</p>

                        <hi>As it is the Spirit that muſt firſt quicken us, ſo it is the ſpirit that draws forth that life and grace that we have.</hi> It is the ſpirit that muſt firſt kindle the fire of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, life, and glory in our ſouls, and then increaſe the flame thereof. Firſt, the wind of the ſpirit blows, then the ſpices of grace flow out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the goodneſſe of the Saints muſt be an overflowing goodneſſe.</hi> The graces of the Saints muſt abound, not onely in themſelves, but <hi>flow out</hi> to others: as it was ſaid of <hi>John, he was a burning, and a ſhining light.</hi> The Spirit of God in his people is like the box of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Mary</hi> powred out, which perfumes all the whole houſe with its ſavour.</p>
                     <p>A Chriſtian never thinks he hath received enough of the ſpirit, unleſſe it makes him to abound in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and flow out to others; unleſſe it be alwayes making new diſcoveries of God and Chriſt to the ſoule, and new revelations of the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the ſoule is refreſht, and the fragrancy of all his graces drawne out to his owne comfort, and the good of others. As the Sun draws forth the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy and ſweetneſſe that is in the flowers of the Earth, when it ſhines upon them; and as the wind doth convey thoſe ſweet ſmells unto us: ſo doth the ſpirit draw forth the ſavour of grace, and convey the ſmell thereof to our owne ſouls and to others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to have the benefite thereof. Thus far of the firſt part of her prayer, deſiring the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South wind to awake and blow upon his Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out.</hi> In the next place we have the Spouſes invitation of Chriſt to <hi>come into his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Let my beloved come,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe words the Spouſe deſireth Chriſts preſence, meaning, that ſhee would have him come and dwell in her, even as he had promiſed in the ſixth Verſe of this Chapter. Thus ſhee invites Chriſt to come into her, as into his Houſe or Temple, calling him Beloved, becauſe the ſtreame of her affections run towards him. Chriſt was (no queſtion) in his Church before, but ſhe deſireth a farther manifeſtation of his preſence, glory, and life in her.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Spouſe never thinks ſhee is neer enough her Beloved, untill ſhee come to the full enjoyment of him. They alwayes waite for a farther revelation of the Lord from Heaven, and cry, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> Revel. 22. 17. That is, come mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thy ſelfe more and more in the revelation of thy ſelfe and glory. It is from the Spirit that we deſire a greater meaſure of the Spirit, and it is from ſome diſcovery of Chriſt in us, that we deſire a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect revelation of him.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth the end and Reaſon wherefore the Spouſe deſireth Chriſt to come into his Garden, which is,</p>

                     <p>The end of the Churches prayer is, that Chriſt might receive honour and glorie, by that ſpirit of grace given out by him unto her, ſhee would have Chriſt come in, and accept his owne graces, which ſhe calleth <hi>pleaſant fruits;</hi> or <hi>fruits of his precious things.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>pleaſant</hi> is of the pluarall number, and may be rendered <hi>ſweetneſſes,</hi> and may note unto us two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The plenitude and fulneſſe of grace in the Saints, they are full of ſweet things, to wit, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It doth denote and ſet out the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of grace, it doth farre exceed in excellencie all the glorious things in the world. Now is it not fit that Chriſt ſhould eate the fruit of his owne Vine, have comfort of his owne garden, taſt of his own fruits? The greateſt delight that Chriſt hath in the world, is in the garden of his Church: therefore, that he might take a full delight therein, he makes it fruitfull, ſtored with precious fruits, as growing from Plants, ſet by his own hand, reliſhed of his own ſpirit, and ſo fitted for his taſt.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>When the winde of the Spirit blows upon the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the ſoule, the graces of the Spirit, as ſweet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces flow out in abundance.

                     <p>They are called his <hi>pleaſant fruits,</hi> as being thoſe he takes much delight in.

The holie actions of the Saints are called <hi>fruits, Joh.</hi> 15. now fruits doe not only ſignifie an iſſuing from the root, but alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight. The acceptation of thoſe fruits, and the communication of farther grace, is ſignified by mutuall ſupping together, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Now wee muſt know that the fruits ſpringing from our natures, that reliſh of the old man, are not thus pleaſing to Chriſt; but the fruits that proceed from the Spirit, or new man: ſuch as theſe are acceptable, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with ſweet odour, ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3.

be from Chriſt. The Apoſtle aſcribes his ſpirituall life to Chriſt, <hi>Gal. 2. 20.

                     <p>Now here is the gracious anſwer of Chriſt, that his Church can no ſooner pray for his preſence, but he ſaith, <hi>I am come into my garden.</hi> Now God is ſaid to come into his garden, when he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his preſence there: ſo the Lord is ſaid to come downe to deliver his people out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that is, by the manifeſting of power and wiſedome in their deliverie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7, 8. and ſo the Lord is ſaid to come downe to ſee the Tower of <hi>Babel, Gen.</hi> 11. 5. that is, he came in a manifeſtation of his judgement upon it: So here when he ſaith, <hi>I am come into my garden,</hi> it is his manifeſting of himſelfe in grace and acceptation, to make ſweet diſcoveries of himſelf, in the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good things, in keeping of a heavenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of divine dainties, wherein he expreſſes his own delight, and the comfort and bleſſing of the Spouſe.

                     <p>God doth ſometimes heare, and anſwer the naturall

                     <p>Laſtly, In that he ſaith, I am come into my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he declares how much delight he takes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his Saints, and make his <hi>Tabernacle with men.</hi>

                     <p>A man taketh much delight and pleaſure in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his garden: ſo doth Chriſt in making out of his preſence in his garden of the Church: wee have many ſcriptures tending this way, as it is witten, <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, above all the inhabitants of Jacob, glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou Citie of God, Pſal.</hi> 7. 8. 2. 3.

Chriſt became our Brother by incarnation, <hi>bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh.</hi> And wee are made his Brethren by adoption, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the ſame ſpirit with him, crying, <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Hence it is, <hi>he is not aſhamed to call us Brethren, Heb.</hi> 2.

God muſt needs accept of ſuch graces that are his owne, and delight in ſuch ſervices that come from love. God firſt accepts of Chriſt, and then of us, and what comes from us in him. The Apoſtle willeth us, <hi>To offer up our ſelves a holy and acceptable ſacrifice to God, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. God doth not only accept, but he delights in the graces of his Spouſe; hence it is he comes with new ſupplies of grace, enlarging his love and benefits, as it is in <hi>Matth. 25. 29. To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> And in <hi>Rev. 22. 12. I come, and my reward is with me.</hi> Chriſt never comes into the ſoule, but he brings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with him, of the increaſings of thoſe graces that were in the ſoule before. Thus we ſee that Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſire of the Spouſe doth come unto her, with acceptation of the fruits of his owne ſpirit in her, and with new increaſings thereof.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth accept of, delight in, and increaſe the leaſt of his owne graces in the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the graces of the Spouſe, though never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or ſmall are accepted, not only her honey, but her honey-comb: not only her wine but her milke; her weake ſervices as well as her ſtrong, becauſe the ſpirit flowing from Chriſt unto her, ſweetneth all. Chriſt doth extol his owne grace, <hi>O woman! great is thy faith, Matth.</hi> 15. 28.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth Chriſts invitation of others unto this banquet, in theſe words.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>Eate O friends, drinke, yea, drinke abundantly, O Beloved.</head>
                     <p>In theſe words Chriſt ſpeaketh, as at a Feaſt,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:118024:273"/>
chearing up his friends, as partaker with him of all thoſe divine graces, and fruits of the ſpirit before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Chriſt is the Maſter of this heavenly banquet, and it is he that here cheereth up his gueſts. It was the cuſtome of the Jewes to powre ointment on their gueſts, to ſhew their welcome, and cheere them up: So Chriſt doth powre out the ointment of his grace and ſpirit, to welcome and cheere up his Saints, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in theſe words, <hi>Eate O friends, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there is a mutual feaſting between Chriſt and his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt provides a heavenly banquet of all ſpirituall dainties, <hi>Of fat things, and the marrow of fatneſſe, wine, and wine on the Lees, Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. and then cals his Saints (as his friends) to partake of thoſe dainties. Chriſt is the fountaine, ſtreaming it ſelfe forth, to refreſh the Citie of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth abundantly ſatisfie his people with all good things. Eate, yea, drinke abundantly, &amp;c.</hi> that is, be ye plenteouſly filled with my grace and ſpirit; no man goeth hungry from a feaſt: in Chriſt there is not only abundance, but a redundancy and overflowing of all good things; Chriſt is able, yea is willing to doe for us farre <hi>more abundantly then wee are able to thinke or ſpeake, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. Chriſt doth not beſtow ſome ſmall meaſure of grace, life, peace, &amp;c. on his people, but he gives it in abundance. It followeth.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt out of the abundance of his affections doth multiply new titles for his Spouſe, calling her, <hi>friend,</hi> and <hi>beloved.</hi> They that doe his commandements, are

his friends, <hi>Joh. 15. 14.

Thoſe good things, that neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare heard, that are above our reach to conceive of, are for thoſe that love him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. Now in that Chriſt doth invite his Spouſe to this heavenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, by new Titles of love and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>All kinds of love and friendſhip, meet in Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Spouſe, and ſo againe, in the Spouſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, here is the friendſhip of all relations in the world, as of <hi>husband, brother, friend,</hi> &amp;c. here is a free opening his boſome to the Saints, and they againe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of their hearts to him. Here's mutuall delight in one anothers good and happineſſe: Chriſt is much delighted in all the good and hapineſſe of the Spouſe, and ſhe is as much delighted in the happineſſe and glorie of Chriſt. So much for the fourth Chapter.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE had in the former Chapter almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the praiſes and commendations which Chriſt giveth to his Church: ſo highly, and with ſo many ſpeeches doth he magnifie and extoll her beauty and her glory and excellency. Here in this Chapter
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:118024:275"/>
we have another manner of ſong, even an accuſing, and a bewailing Song: for here ſhee accuſeth her ſelf, and bewaileth her owne unkindneſſe and undutifull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſhe ſhewed to her moſt kind and loving Spouſe, reporting alſo the great affliction and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that came upon her by that meanes. And after all this, we have the meanes whereby ſhee recovers her ſelfe againe.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter obſerve two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a complaint of the Spouſe, which ſhe maketh, accuſing her ſelfe for ſome negligences towards her beloved, and this is contained in the ſix firſt Verſes. Wherein alſo there are two eſpeciall matters delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, an open acknowledgment of her offence committed, Verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a recitall of the miſeries that fell upon her by meanes of her neglect, Verſ. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing ſet forth unto us in this Chapter, is, a familiar parly had betweene the Spouſe, and ſuch as were her friends and acquaintance, who demanding ſome queſtions of her, the Church inſtructeth them concerning the ſtate, dwelling, and mutuall fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is betwixt her and Chriſt. This matter beginneth at Verſ. 7. and reacheth to the end of the Chapter. The queſtions with the anſwers thereto, concerne two things.</p>
                  <p>1. There is ſomething demanded about Chriſt himſelfe in Verſ. 8. whereunto there is a large anſwer, beginning at the 9. Verſ. and holdeth to the 15. wherein the Spouſe doth ſet forth her beloved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny elegant expreſſions: the iſſue whereof was, that the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> became likewiſe enamour'd
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:118024:275"/>
with him, and therefore queſtion the place of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode: the queſtion being contained in Verſ. 16. and the anſwer in the two laſt verſes: the occaſion both of the one, and of the other, was that vehement charge that the Spouſe giveth her friends, in the ſeaventh verſe, both concerning Chriſt himſelfe, and the place where they ſhould find him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that offers it ſelfe to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, the Churches complaint, accuſing of her ſelfe, ſaying,</p>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>
                        <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>Here is a deſcription of the Churches temptation, which is worldly drowſineſſe and ſecurity, wherein to the godly ſometimes fall. She had enjoyed a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table intercourſe with Chriſt, but now ſhe falleth into a deep temptation, from the ſtrength and prevalency of corruption.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve in the generall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Spouſe is not alwayes in one and the ſame temper.</hi> It was not long agoe that the Spouſe was in a ſweet, lovely, gracious temper; and now on the ſuddaine ſhee falls into a fit of drouſineſſe and ſecurity. Thus it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſomtimes ſtrong in faith, and ſomtimes fearfull, as when he denyed his wife. <hi>David</hi> was ſomtimes full of confidence and boldneſſe, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Whom ſhall I feare?</hi> And ſomtimes againe, <hi>I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul.</hi> So <hi>Peter,</hi> ſomtimes confident, and againe, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overcome with feare.

                     <head>I ſleep, but my heart waketh.</head>
                     <p>The words containe,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A Confeſſion, <hi>I ſleep.</hi>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Theſe words declare a two-fold condition of the Spouſe. The one is a ſleepy, drowſie eſtate, which proceedeth from the fleſh and unregenerate part: the other, a waking or watchfull condition, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the ſpirit of Chriſt within her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſleep,</hi> or <hi>I ſleeping,</hi> as it is in the Originall: theſe are the words of the Spouſe, declaring what befell her in the night ſeaſon while ſhe ſlept. The ſleep of the body is a deading and benuming of the outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſomuch that it is the very image of death, and it is dangerous, becauſe when man ſleepeth, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my watcheth, as in the parable of the ſeed, <hi>When the husbandman ſlept, the envious man ſowed Tares,</hi> Matth. 13. 25.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt conſider here three things eſpecially.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. What this ſleep is.</item>
                        <item>2. Whence it proceedeth.</item>
                        <item>3. What the effects thereof be.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. We cannot underſtand this of a bodily or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſleep; for the Spouſe is conſidered according to her heavenly and ſpirituall birth, and therefore muſt needs be meant of a ſpirituall ſlumber, even a drouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the heart and minde, touching Heavenly things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As naturall ſleep proceedeth from wearineſſe, and want of ſpirits, or from ſloathfullneſſe and want of exerciſe: ſo ſpirituall ſleep ariſeth from want of exerciſe in ſpirituall things, and from a ſpirituall
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:118024:276"/>
wearineſſe that comes from the too much expence of the ſtrength of the ſoule upon matters of the world. So that ſpirituall ſlumber is from the fleſhly part, and the remnants of the old man remaining in the godly. <hi>The fleſh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit is againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that yee cannot doe the things that yee would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. When the fleſh doth much prevaile, then there is a damping of the ſpirituall graces, even as it were a ſlumber that falleth upon the mind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The effects of ſleep is deadneſſe and darkneſſe; men when they ſleep love to be in the darke: there is alſo a ceſſation of joy and delight, of all activity and the like: ſo in a Chriſtians ſpirituall ſleep, faith hath not its full and lively operation, love ſheweth not her zeale and heate, the joy and activity of the ſoule is much decayed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now though ſleep be often meant in Scripture in a good ſence, for the repoſe and reſt that the Saints have in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 5. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 8. yet here, and in many other places, it ſignifieth neglect of holineſſe, and ſpirituall ſecurity and drowſineſſe; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10. &amp; <hi>Rom. 13. 11. 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 6, 7. This ſleep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from affliction, or wearineſſe, as in <hi>Luke 22. 45. Iſa. 5. 27.</hi> The Spouſe having eaten, and dranke largely of Chriſts dainties, begins to be negligent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed thereunto by the remnants of the fleſh, ſhe gave place to this carnall eaſe and drouſineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Spouſe of Chriſt is ingenuous to lay open her owne defects.</hi> We have large examples of this in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> with many other eminent perſons in Scripture. Herein the Saints yield unto God his
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:118024:277"/>
chiefe prerogatives, as the honour of his power and authority over us; his wiſedome in knowing our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and his mercy in ſparing of us, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Spouſe of Chriſt may ſometimes fall into a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall languor.</hi> Sometimes weakneſſe and drowſineſſe may overtake the moſt eminent Saints; as <hi>Solomon, David, Peter,</hi> and the reſt. The fleſh that is alwayes oppoſed to the ſpirit, may ſomtimes for a ſeaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, as to ſleepineſſe and diſtemper. And this the Apoſtle teſtifieth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. when he ſaith, <hi>The Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall, ſold under ſin.</hi> That is, the <hi>Law</hi> requires a heavenly life and diſpoſition: <hi>But I am carnall,</hi> in part, or in regard of the remainders of fleſh that are in me: ſo that the godly themſelves in reſpect of ſome weakneſſe that is yet remaining in them, may be called <hi>carnall: ſold under ſin,</hi> not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but as one that is yet detained, though his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome be paid.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt note here, that the Spouſe was not in ſuch a dead ſleep, as that ſhe was without any life or ſtirring at all; though there be fleſh oppoſing the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet there is ſpirit oppoſing the fleſh; and therefore ſhe doth not onely confeſſe her defect, but alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her life and excellency, by adding,</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="543" facs="tcp:118024:277"/>
The <hi>heart</hi> is taken for the whole ſoule, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will, men ory, and affections: ſo it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all the powers of the ſoule. The Apoſtle calleth it the <hi>inward man,</hi> the ſpirit, or regenerate man, oppoſed to the fleſh or outward man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. This fleſh and ſpirit luſteth oue againſt another, even in the Saints, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. And when the <hi>ſpirit is willing the fleſh is weake,</hi> Mat. 26. 41. So then, in that the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>My heart waketh,</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that though ſhe had given her ſelfe to fleſhly caſe and ſecurity, yet her heart and ſpirit was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed. The heart is the laſt part which liveth and moveth in the body, and in it life and ſence firſt beginneth, and therefore it is the moſt principal part, it is like <hi>Primum mobile inter ſphaeras,</hi> the firſt ſpheare celeſtiall which is moved, and by it others are moved: It is like the Sunne among the Planets, which by its luſtre giveth light unto the reſt: it is like the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from which the lines are firſt defixed and derived from it to the circumference, all the lines being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted are of equall diſtance. But here by the heart is not underſtood the ſubſtance, but the quality of the heart; where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Create in me a new heart,</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. We muſt not underſtand it of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for that is ſtill the ſame, but the quality of the heart, with its integrity. But now the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a difference between her ſelfe and her heart, as if her ſelfe and her heart were not the ſame, where ſhe ſaith, <hi>I ſleep,</hi> ſhe ſpeaketh in the perſon of her outward man, of the fleſh, not of the ſpirit: but where ſhe ſpeaketh of her heart ſhe ſpeaketh of her inward man, there was readineſſe of ſpirit.</p>

                        <hi>That there is an antitheſis or contrariety betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, in the Saints.</hi> The Saints have a fleſhly backwardneſſe, but there is ſtill a readineſſe of ſpirit, but the outward man, which is fleſh, periſheth, but the inward man that is ſpirit, is renewed day by day. So the Apoſtle comparing himſelfe with himſelfe is not himſelfe, where he ſaith, <hi>I am carnall, ſold under ſin: for in me, (that is in my fleſh) there dwelleth no good, but I allow not that which I doe. I find a law in my members rebelling againſt the law of my mind.</hi> There the fleſh ſleepeth, <hi>But to will is preſent with me, and I delight in the Law of God,</hi> there is the inward man, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit waking. Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints cannot fall from grace.</hi> Though they ſleep, yet their heart is awake. The work of the new birth, or Spirit, can never be quite put out, or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The Saints may many times fall into great ſecurity, but yet the heart waketh, there remaineth ſomewhat within, the ſleep is not deadly. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the Church and Saints of God, ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be as a Tree, as an Oake, whoſe ſubſtance is in them when they caſt their leaves,</hi> Iſa. 6. 13. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teſtified by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is borne of God, ſinneth not, for his ſeed remaineth in him, neither can he ſin, becauſe he is borne of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. So that here is ſtill life in the root, <hi>The ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in them;</hi> from whence it is, that when the Spouſe ſleepeth, her heart waketh: and from hence it is, that ſhee cannot loſe the worke of God in her, that ſhe is borne of God, who is immortall and unchangeable. And it is written, <hi>Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth, that it may beare more fruit,</hi> John 15. No fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full branch ſhall be cut off.</p>

Thirdly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints ſhould as well acknowledge that which is good, as that which is evill in their ſpirits.</hi> It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with ſome Chriſtians to be ever complaining of that evill they ſee in themſelves, but very ſeldome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any of that good they have received: whereas we ought to acknowledge all the good we have received, to the praiſe of the giver.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That a Christian is what he is in ſpirit.</hi> A believer is not to value himſelf acording to what he is in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, or in the fleſh, but as he is in the inward man, or ſpirit. So the Church values her ſelfe by the diſpoſition and temper of her ſpirit. <hi>My heart waketh,</hi> thus hath the Spouſe in few words ſet forth her eſtate, according to fleſh and ſpirit: and now ſhe ſetteth forth in the next place the great care and love of Chriſt, who ſeeketh to awake, and to raiſe her out of this dangerous ſleep, in theſe words.</p>

Chriſts Sheep are ſaid, <hi>To heare Chriſts voyce,</hi> John 10. And <hi>to taſt words by the eare,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 11. they have a ſpirituall taſt and reliſh with them. The voyce of Chriſt is ſpirit and life, and hath in it, a ſelf-diſcovering property, it carries along with it, its owne evidence: it hath ſuch majeſty and power, ſuch evidence and life in it, that the Spouſe cannot but heare and diſcerne it, even in a ſleepy and ſlumbring temper.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>

Thus much for the Churches taking notice of Chriſts voyce: we come to Chriſts carriage towards her, which is ſet forth, firſt, by his action, <hi>He knocketh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:118024:280"/>
doth intimate Chriſts earneſtneſſe for an entrance, to come in and awake his Spouſe. And thus Chriſt is ſaid to knock at the doore of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Revel. 3. 19, 20. Chriſt hath ſeverall kinds of knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as that of his word, his mercy, his Spirit, and ſomtimes his Rod, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9. yea, all the meanes that Chriſt uſeth to draw us nearer to himſelfe, as his works, ſpirit, word, and the conſcience too, theſe are the knockings of Chriſt at our hearts. Now Chriſt doth not onely knock, but he is moſt earneſt for an enterance, ſaying,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>Open unto me.</head>
                     <p>Here the heart is compared to the gates or doors of a City; for as in Cities, the ſtrength of the City is in the gates, there was their ſeats of juſtice in thoſe days, and there was Munition ſtored up for war, ſo that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates to an enemy, and you give him all. So when Chriſt hath the heart, he hath the whole man. The heart is the way of entrance of God into the ſoul, or into the whole man, and hence it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia,</hi> Acts 16. 14. That was it, at which Chriſt knocked. When God beſtoweth his bleſſings on us, he is ſaid <hi>to open doors unto us,</hi> as in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78. 23, 24. &amp; in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 1, 2, 3. The Apoſtle calleth the grace of miniſtry, <hi>The doore of utterance,</hi> Col. 4. 3. So when we yield unto Chriſt, and his Spirit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his grace, and the like, it is to open the doore unto him, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Now the knockings of Chriſt ſhew how earneſt he is of enterance into his Spouſe, ſaying <hi>open unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt deſires a neerer and neerer fellowſhip with his Spouſe.</hi>

Hence it is, that he knocks for a farther entrance and communion, he had communion before, but he comes to renew and enlarge it. Chriſt doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſtrangeneſſe, but makes forth abundance of love to the ſoules of his Saints, that ſo he might have a further entrance into their hearts and affections. You know what he ſayes to the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Revel. 3. 20. Behold I ſtand at the doore and knock.</hi> So here, <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may object, Chriſt hath power to open to himſelfe, why doth he ſtand knocking, man hath no power to open of himſelfe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The anſwer is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Here Chriſt ſpeakes to the Spouſe, that had the ſpirit of God, by which ſhe could open to her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for the Saints are firſt acted by the Spirit, and then they act by it, not in their owne power; but in the power of the ſpirit. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When Chriſt comes for an entrance at converſion: then there goes a power, that ſhall open: for his knockings are effectuall: his words are opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words, ſuch as was in the creation, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light, Geneſ.</hi> 1. 3. And ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come forth of the grave, &amp;c. Joh</hi> 11. 43. So Chriſt by his Spirit, cloathes his words with majeſtie, and power, <hi>his words are ſpirit and life,</hi> and when he ſpeakes effectually, he opens and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks the heart with the power of his voice.</p>
                     <p>Now followeth the particular compellations, which are as ſo many motives Chriſt uſeth to move and ſtirre the affections of his Spouſe.</p>

Tis a metaphor taken from thoſe that are gone to bed, and are loath to riſe for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans pleaſure, and the meaning may be this, that ſhe had now ſhaken off many feares and troubles; ſhe was free from perfecution, and delivered from many afflictions and miſeries formerly endured; ſhe had now throwne off theſe things, as one going to bed doth his garments; ſhe had waſh't them off, as in the Eaſtern countries, travailers were wont to waſh off the ſoile of their feet, when they went to their reſt, and ſhe was now in the bed of fleſhly eaſe, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentment, loath to diſreſt her ſelfe, loath to riſe and be pincht with cold againe, loath to ſet her feet into the dirt of former ſufferings, though in her heart ſhe preferred Chriſt above all; yet ſo ſweet were thoſe earthly accomodations, that ſhe would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbear intercourſe with him for a while, then loſe her ſhare in thoſe fleſhly enjoyments.

                  <p>Thoſe that underſtand by putting off her garments, the renouncing of the old man, and by waſhing of her feet, the ſanctification of her affections, are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for the more ſhe had of either the one or the other, the neerer ſhe was to Chriſt, and the more ſoone ſhe might have entertained him; but the true naturall ſenſe is as before. In ſum, ſhe meaneth, that ſhe reaſoned to and fro in her heart, and that her faith did greatly waver, yea, that her owne weakneſſe did ſo farre prevaile with her, as not only to thinke, but to ſay, that ſhe could not without ſome paine of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing herſelfe againe, or without ſome hurt by the cold, if ſhe came without her apparell, or without ſome diſcommoditie of fowling her faire feet, as ſhe thought, riſe up, and to open the doores, and let Chriſt in: yea, unwiſe, as ſhe was, ſhee more eſteemed ſo ſmall a diſcommoditie, in doing and executing of her dutie, then the unſpeakeable pleaſures ſhe might have had by Chriſt, who willingly for her ſake, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him many inconveniencies, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a great hinderance of our communion with Christ is, the falſe pretences, reaſons, and excuſes of the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fleſh never wants excuſes and pretences, there was never any ſinfull courſe, but the fleſh would ſeem
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:118024:284"/>
to juſtifie it by one reaſon or other. Thus the friend anſwereth (in <hi>Luke 11. 7.) Trouble me not, the doore is now ſhut, and my Children are now with me in bed, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe and give thee.</hi> Therefore as it is good to know the truths of God, as they are revealed in Jeſus, ſo it is alſo to know the falſeneſſe and deceitfullneſſe of our owne fleſhly and carnall ſpirits, they are both myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries almoſt alike, hard to be knowne. It is true, God made man right, but ſince the fall he hath ſought out many inventions. Carnall wit ſerves the carnall will, and carnall luſts never want an advocate to plead for them, namely, carnall reaſon. <hi>There is a Lyon in the way</hi> (ſaith the ſluggard) <hi>a Lyon is in the ſtreets,</hi> Prov. 26. 3. And <hi>the ſluggard will not plough by reaſon of the cold,</hi> Prov. 20. 4. So the people that dwelt in their <hi>ſeiled</hi> houſes, ſaid, <hi>The time is not come that the Lords houſe ſhould be built,</hi> Hag. 1. 4. Such kind of ſhifting there is in loſt man, ſince the fall, having loſt the image of God in holy wiſdome and knowledge. Corrupt courſes never want fleſhly excuſes. Hence it is, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I conſulted not with fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, he conſulted not with the reaſonings of the fleſh, and the carnall will, but was obedient to the heavenly revelation. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> conſulted with the fleſh, when he counſelled Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Maſter pity thy ſelfe.</hi> Now therefore we ſhould arme our ſelves with reſolution, and ſay with Chriſt, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 16. 23. And with <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>We are no more debtors to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. as if he had ſaid, we owe nothing to the fleſh, as to yield obedience and ſubjection unto it.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall now ſee in the next Verſe, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of all thoſe excuſes, and backwardneſſe of the

                  <p>IN theſe and the 3. following Verſes, we have the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of the Spouſes negligence, that Chriſt abſented and withdrew himſelfe. There are three things ſet downe of what befell the Spouſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts withdrawing of himſelfe, he leaveth her for a time to her ſelfe, and to her owne wayes; but it is ſaid, <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the doore.</hi> Chriſt did not wholly leave his Spouſe though he did withdraw: and therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have Chriſts gracious dealing with her, not wholly withdrawing himſelfe, but <hi>puts his finger into the hole of the doore,</hi> and thereby leaves ſome ſweetneſſe behind him before his departure, So <hi>that her hands dropped downe Myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſucceſſe of Chriſts departure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of himſelfe, <hi>Her bowells were moved in her,</hi> which were hard before, whereupon <hi>ſhe opens to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> as now being willing to receive him, but he is not at her call ready to be found, he <hi>was gone and paſt,</hi> not indeed, but according to her ſence and feeling, and that onely for a time. After this, like one that falleth into a ſwoone, ſhe is void of inward comfort, and ſence of Chriſts preſence, where ſhe ſaith, <hi>My ſoule failed when he ſpake,</hi> that is, when I remembred the words which he did ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, ſhe cannot find her beloved, ſhe then
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:118024:285"/>
enquires of the Watch-men of the City, but ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no comfort from them, but they are like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Cold comforters are you all,</hi> Job 16. 2. for they wound her conſcience, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully uſe her, where it is ſaid, <hi>They tooke away her Veile from her.</hi> So in her preſent apprehenſion, ſhe paſſeth all meanes of recovery, yet in the following verſes, ſhe doth recover her ſelfe againe, becauſe Chriſt left her not wholly, but leaves ſome of his ſweetneſſe behind him before he departed from her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the doore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spouſe is no ſooner fallen into this ſpirituall languor and drouſineſſe, making excuſes for her ſloath and ſecurity, but Chriſt comes to rouſe her up, and that firſt by withdrawing himſelfe after a ſort from her, but yet he will firſt leave that behind him, that ſhall both raiſe her up to ſeek after him, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her in her afflictions. <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the doore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>His hand,</hi> that is, his ſpirit, by which he moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, by which he went to awake her. For as the <hi>finger of God</hi> (in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20.) meaneth the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> ſo doth his <hi>Hand.</hi> Hence it is ſaid, that when the Spirit of the Lord went out with the miniſtry of the Diſciples, <hi>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord,</hi> Acts 11. 19.
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:118024:286"/>
So in that it is ſaid, Chriſt put in his hand it's meant, he did inwardly move upon her heart, by the ſweet and ſecret opperation of his glorious Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In at the hole)</hi> or, <hi>downe by the hole,</hi> towit, of the <hi>doore,</hi> as it's added in our Tranſlation. The ſimilitude is taken from hence, when a doore is locked, yet there is a key-hole at which one may put in his hand, or look in, and ſo here, when the hearts of the faithfull be after a ſort locked up, and Chriſt ſtandeth at the doore of the heart, and calleth, and knocketh, yet they doe not open unto him, but make excuſes, he findeth ſome little entrance or hole, as through the doore, to put in his hand of ſpirit, to touch the inward parts of the heart; that ſo he might leave ſome print of his fingers before he did depart.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt never leaves his Spouſe ſo, but that he leaves ſome prints of his ſpirit and grace behind him, upon her ſoul.</hi> Hence it is, the ſoule doth ſo linger after him, when he hath withdrawne himſelfe, and never reſts untill it finds him againe. There is never a finall deſertion, as we ſee here. Chriſt <hi>puts his hand in at the doore,</hi> he leaves ſome inward workings of his gracious ſpirit, to quicken the ſoule to ſeek after him, and alſo to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it in its affliction. Chriſt ſtands at the doore, and leaves Myrrhe behind him, ſomething in the heart that cauſeth a reſtleſſe longing after Chriſt, as appears by that which followeth this touch of his Spirit.</p>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>And my bowells were moved for him.</head>
                     <p>Some read the words thus, <hi>My heart was affectioned toward him.</hi> Maſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> thus, <hi>My bowells made a troubled noiſe, or ſounded within me.</hi> Whereby is
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:118024:286"/>
meant, that all the inward affections and powers of the mind, are moved with griefe and ſorrow. Now ſhe is grieved and diſpleaſed with her ſelfe, now ſhe lamenteth her owne folly, that ſhe was ſo undutifull towards her beloved, now her heart is againe wrapt with love of him, now ſhe will entertaine him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified then all her diſquietneſſe and ſorrow of heart for her beloved, whom ſhe had ſo neglected, and put from her, when he deſired to come in. Thus the Prophet declares his ſorrow, by ſaying, <hi>My bowells, my bowells, I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh a noyſe, I cannot hold my peace,</hi> Jer. 4. 19. And ſo God himſelfe, in pity of <hi>Ephraims</hi> calamity, faith, <hi>My bowels ſounded</hi> (or were troubled) <hi>for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 20. So here, the Spouſe, by the ſounding of her bowells, ſheweth the griefe and ſorrow of her heart, her mourning and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing after her beloved.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the power of Chriſts Spirit makes a great change in thoſe into whom it comes.</hi> Behold here the power of the Spirit, what an alteration it makes in men, how far it changeth them from that which they were before: downe goeth the power of the fleſh where it commeth. An example of it you may ſee in the Apoſtles of Chriſt: how weake and how fearfull were they at Chriſts ſufferings, but after the holy Ghoſt came downe upon them in the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, of a company of weake and trembling Lambs, they became ſo many mighty Lyons, they feared not the whole world. So it is with all Saints, they be heavy, and lumpiſh and dull, when the fleſh hath the ſtroke, and beareth the ſway, every ſmall impediment
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:118024:287"/>
is a hinderance, and miniſtreth ſome excuſe to keep them back, and the excuſes ſeem alſo to be reaſonable, but when the touch of the holy Spirit commeth, that Chriſt put in his hand at the hole of the doore, then there is a quickneſſe, a life and moving, then nothing can let, but they will ſeeke Chriſt. It is a wonderfull change and alteration that the Lord makes in man, when he putteth downe the fleſh, and raigneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the power of his Spirit. We remaine dull, ſlow, fearfull, weake and negligent, becauſe we reſt in our owne power ſo much, and in the power of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo little.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But ſome will ſay, Doth not Chriſt dwell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the hearts of his people? How then is it ſaid that Chriſt knocketh to have them open unto him, and let him in, and they make excuſes to put him off? Or how is it then that he toucheth them with his ſpirit now, which they had before?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt note, that there be degrees of the meaſure of the gifts of the Spirit. The Apoſtles had the ſpirit before Chriſts aſcenſion, but not in that meaſure as afterward: ſo alſo Chriſt dwelleth in all the Saints, even in thoſe that have the leaſt ſparke of true light, but he knoketh to have them open the doors of their hearts wider, and to receive him after a more full manner. And thus we have the Pſalmiſt, ſaying, <hi>Lift up your heads yee gates, and be ye lift up yee everlaſting dooes, and the King of glory ſhall come in,</hi> Pſal. 24. we muſt ſet our hearts wide open, that Chriſt may come in, and reigne over us, and wholly ſway us by the Scepter of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt never ſo deſerts his Spouſe, but leaves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:118024:287"/>
behind him which makes her ſenſible of his abſence, and reſtleſſe in her deſires after him.</hi> Hence the Spouſe is troubled in ſpirit, ſorrow and calamity preſently fell upon her, when ſhe faith, <hi>My bowells were moved for him.</hi> That is, my heart was affectioned towards him, all my inward affections and powers of my mind were moved with griefe and ſorrow, I was reſtleſſe in my ſpirit after him, nothing in the world would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me but the injoyment of my beloved, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, whom once I enjoyed with unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable delight. Theſe, and ſuch like affections was the Spouſe moved withall. The Spouſe is not only affected inwardly in her mind, but ſhe is alſo ſtirred up to ſeeke after her beloved, as appears in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe.</p>

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:118024:290"/>
doth withdraw himſelfe out of their ſight, eſpecially when he hath made their hands to drop with myrrhe? This is out of queſtion, that Chriſt is alwayes preſent in the ſouls of the faithfull, and yet to their thinking and apprehenſion he ſeemeth to be abſent. He doth ſtill ſupport them by his power and ſpirit, and yet they have not the lively and comfortable feeling of his preſence which they deſire, and ſometimes happily did enjoy. Then the heart is troubled, then they mourne, then they ſeeke and call after him, for ſhee ſaith.</p>

                  <p>Theſe watchmen are ſaid to be ſuch as goe about the City, which noteth their painfullneſſe and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as of thoſe that watch and ward in the City day and night, meaning the officers of the Church, as before was noted, in Chap. 3. 3. where the ſelfe-ſame thing is put downe, ſaving that there is no mention made of their abuſing of her, but onely of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who thereby could tell where he was that her ſoul loved.

As it was an ornament, as in the Old Teſtament, a Vaile was that which covered women for modeſty, ſo it was an honourable Ornament. <hi>They tooke away the Vaile.</hi> That is, that wherewith the Spouſe was covered, they tooke away that which made her comely, and laid her open, and as it were naked, by calumnies and reproaches, caſting all the mire and dirt they could upon her. They tooke away the Vaile of the Spouſe, when they tooke away her credit and eſteeme, when they lay open her infirmities and weakneſſes. So ſhe was ſpoiled of her good name, and reputation, and counted among the light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

lewd women, for ſo they uſed to deale with diſhoneſt women, disfiguring their faces, ſtripping them out of their cloaths, and taking away their faire Jewells, as appears by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 25, 26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the Vaile is a token of ſubjection, it's taken away when they draw the Spouſe from Chriſt, and her ſubjection to him, by falſe doctrines and humane traditions and inventions of men, by preſſing humane devices upon the Spouſe, and ſo take her off from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe things that Chriſt hath given her in truſt to obſerve. Thoſe that deſire to ſit high in the conſciences of people, and ſo make them undutifull, they take away the Vaile of ſubjection from them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to obſerve humane traditions more then Chriſts Commandements.</p>
                     <p>Now in that the Spouſe is thus vexed and afflicted by theſe evill watchmen, who were ſuch as ſeemed to be in place of ſuperintendency and miniſtry, ſuch as pretended at leaſt to have the greateſt care of her, for theſe to <hi>ſmite</hi> her, <hi>wound</hi> her, and <hi>take away her Vaile:</hi> this was moſt ſavage dealing, and the very higheſt of perſecution.</p>

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:118024:294"/>
to the truth. As for Miniſters, they call themſelves the Embaſſadors of Chriſt, and therefore ſtrengthen the feeble knees, and bind up the broken hearted, and the like: But alas, we ſee many of theſe turne the edge of the ſword againſt the Saints. The Prophets of God doe complaine of the wicked Prieſts in the time of the Law, how they did afflict the godly: And may not the ſame complaint be made ſtill? even now in the days of the Goſpell, how are the Saints ſtill vexed with many of that Tribe. What is the cauſe they be ſo much dlſpleaſed? Surely becauſe the Saints ſeeke after Chriſt, and that out of their way and order: they will beare any diſorder ſaving that: men may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, formall, yea, and profane too, and ſuch are no trouble to their ſpirits; like the blind <hi>Phariſoes,</hi> if there be any exceſſe of ryot, theſe watchmen can beare it well enough, but if any ſeeke acquaintance with Chriſt, and not in their way, that is intollerable, that is to their diſgrace, upon ſuch they fall, they beat and wound them; yea, <hi>they take away their Vaile:</hi> they doe deface and diſhonour them all they can, for they make them as odious as they can; they terme them that be Saints, and ſeeke after Chriſt, <hi>Hereticks, Scihſmaticks, Elaſphemers,</hi> and the like: they lay all the moſt vile reproaches upon them they can deviſe. Now for the Saints, this need not trouble them, when theſe things come to paſſe, that ſuch as pretend to have office, and ſuperintendency over the Church, doe beat, wound, and diſgrace her. Did not the builders refuſe Chriſt himſelfe, the head corner ſtone? What marvaile then, though they beat his Servants and vex his people. How was Chriſt judged of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in his time? And this hath been
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:118024:295"/>
the lot of the Church in all ages, the Saints were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, the Vaile was taken off. O what cruelty is this? What ſavage men are theſe that thus beat and wound the Spouſe of Chriſt? Yea, marke well how they be: They be the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that pretend to be Miniſters and Embaſſadors of Chriſt for to feed his flock, who of all others ſhould chiefly defend and comfort them: now for theſe to <hi>beat</hi> and <hi>wound</hi> the Spouſe, and take away her Vaile, this is intollerable wickedneſſe, this is the higheſt impiety.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, truth hath alwayes a ſaracht face; falſhood, and formality for the moſt part goe under glorious attire, as that of decency and uniformity, and the like. There is no queſtion, that ſuch as are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Formaliſts, Phariſaicall Profeſſors, would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Chriſt if he were in the fleſh, as now they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his imageand ſpirit in his Saints, when they ſmite and wound and take away their Vaile from them.

                  <p>IN the former part of the Chapter, we have heard how the Bridegroom calling and knocking to raiſe
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:118024:295"/>
his Spouſe out of her ſleep, even from her carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, what excuſes ſhe made, how unkindly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully ſhe dealt with him. Moreover we have heard how he for the ſame unkindneſſe, did withdraw himſelfe from her; ſhe ſeeketh after him, and falleth into the hands of the watchmen, even into the hands of falſe Paſtors, which dealt with her very cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, they beat her, they wounded her, and tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her Vaile from her. But what doth the Spouſe now? Doth ſhe give over ſeeking her beloved? No verily, ſhe goeth on in her ſearch ſtill, and is more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement then before: when ſhe was under the power of the fleſh, ſhe thought it ſomewhat unreaſonable to ſeeke after her beloved, and began to excuſe her ſelfe, ſaying, <hi>I have put off my Coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Chriſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to require that at her hands which was without all reaſon, but after he had touched her inwardly by his ſpirit, ſhe doth not ſay, I have ſought him, and by ſeeking him have been beaten, wounded, and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, how ſhall I ſeeke him any longer? There is now a fire kindled in her which none can quench, the fleſh now with all the excuſes which it can make, is put to ſilence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Saints doe never more priſe Chriſt, nor ſeek after him with more affection, then in the time of hot perſecution.</hi> The practiſe of the Spouſe here doth plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, beſide all experience ſheweth the ſame. It was to this purpoſe that Chriſt put in his hand at the hole of the door, &amp; left that ſweet myrrhe with which his fingers did drop. The truth is, that though Chriſt ſeemed to withdraw, and to abſent himſelfe from his
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:118024:296"/>
Spouſe, yet by the inward workings of his ſpirit, by putting in his hand, he is very neer unto them, and doth by his wiſdome, power, and goodneſſe, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſupport and comfort them. Now let us deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend downe to the particulars themſelves. And firſt take a generall reſolution of this latter part of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The Spouſe having thus long ſought her beloved, and not finding him, no not among the watchmen that ſhould have given her beſt inſtruction; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that never dying affection in her, ſhe doth nor let her beloved goe altogether, but ſtill ſeeketh him, even among ſuch friends as know him not ſo well as her ſelfe, as one that will refuſe no meanes to find him. So at laſt by degrees, firſt uttering her earneſt deſire, and making diligent ſearch after him, ſhe find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth comfort in her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words we have therefore.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Spouſe enquiring among her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for her beloved, <hi>verſ. 7.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, ſhe maketh unto them a deſcription of him, how he might be knowne from other men. This deſcription is made.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, She deſcends downe to that which is more particular, ſetting him forth by all the members and lineaments of his body; and doth ſet him forth (as we uſe to ſay) from top to toe, beginning at his head, which is the moſt eminent part of the body, ſaying, <hi>His head is as moſt fine gold, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 10. &amp;c. and ſo to

verſe 15. and ſo concludeth in a generall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of him, ſhewing that he was precious and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his whole ſelfe; ſaying, <hi>He is altogether lovely,</hi> or, he is lovely in all parts, yea, <hi>he is all over lovely,</hi> he is wholly delectable, crying out with an exclamation? <hi>This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, it was made knowne to her at length, where he is to be found: <hi>My beloved is gone downe into his garden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now to the firſt verſe that I read.</p>

then from the watchmen of the walls. What comfort could the Saints receive from the falſe Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the time of the Law? or, what ſatisfaction may the godly receive from the Scribes and Phariſees in Chriſts time? and as little may the Saints expect now from many, that pretend to the Office of Prieſthood, or miniſtry. Surely, many a Saint knows by experience, that more ſatisfaction and comfort is to be had from many a poore diſpiſed Member of their congregation, then from the great Rabbies and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the world: and no marvaile; for, <hi>God ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrength out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings, Pſal. 8.</hi> And he <hi>hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty: and the baſe things of the world, and things that are diſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no fleſh ſhould glorie in his preſence, 1 Cor. 1. 27, 28, 29.</hi> No fleſhly nor carnall man ſhall boaſt in Gods ſight; and therefore by his wiſedome and power he will overturne the wiſedome and power of fleſh: that his owne ſpirit, wiſedome, power, and righteouſneſſe might be exalted in his Saints.

But now if the fleſh had borne ſway, that would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned after another way, as thus: I opened the doore, and he withdrew himſelfe, and by that occaſion I have ſuffered great calamitie, therefore I have ſmall cauſe to love him: ſeeing he doth hide himſelfe from me, and cauſe me to be thus ſtricken and wounded, why ſhould I ſet my heart upon him?

miniſter ſuch kinde of reaſons, but the Saints are not led by the fleſh and its wiſdome, but by the Spirit which teacheth them, the more they ſuffer for Chriſt, the more to love him. This is a thing beyond the reach of humane reaſon, the Spouſe having fallen into ſo great affliction by ſeeking after her head Chriſt, is thereupon ſick of love. The Saints rejoyce in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and count it their honour to ſuffer for Chriſt, and the more they ſuffer in his name, he doth ſo ſtrengthen them, and worke in them by the Spirit, that the more they love him.

                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Spouſe, though perſecuted and abuſed by wicked <hi>watchmen,</hi> who beate her, wounded her, and tooke away her vaile from her, is not withſtanding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and acknowledged to be faire and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by ſuch as are the faithfull of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus <hi>Moſes eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſures of Aegypt,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. And the <hi>Theſſalonians received the Goſpell, with joy; though in much affliction,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 1. 6.

                     <p>Here is a queſtion, and a queſtion anſwered by a queſtion, wherein the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſeeme to be as much inquiſitive after Chriſt, as the Spouſe herſelfe, They double the queſtion, for the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, as alſo for the ſtrangeneſſe of the matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is thy beloved more then another;</hi> to wit, any other Gods: for, when Chriſt is preached, the wicked take occaſion to crie up and magnifie other Gods, But the Saints deſire to be informed further in the truth, and to know the difference between Chriſt and falſe Chriſts, between Chriſt and Antichriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 19. 34. &amp;c.</p>

doeſt ſo charge us? Viz.</hi> So hardly, and ſtraightly, &amp; even as it were, by vertue of an Oath. Something there is in the matter that thou layeſt ſo hard a burthen, and ſtraight charge upon us, or elſe thou wouldeſt not doe it. This is the firſt queſtion moved to the Church, concerning the perſon of her beloved, they marvelling, as it were, what excellency ſhould be in him, that ſhe ſhould ſo highly eſteem of him, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which demand ſhe entereth into a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſt, as in the verſes following. Theſe words being ſomewhat plaine, need no further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but let us take notice of ſome Obſervations from them. Firſt Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the earneſt ſeeking of the faithfull after Chriſt, is a meanes to ſtir up others to inquire what he is, or what there is in him.</hi> Common reaſon will lead men thus far, when they ſee that no threatnings, no affliction, bonds, tortures nor ſufferings whatſoever, can prevaile, but that the Saints doe become more earneſt in ſeeking Chriſt, to ſay within themſelves, it's out of queſtion there is ſome great thing that carrieth theſe men, it's no ſmall benefit for which they will endure all theſe things. Hereupon theſe daughters begin to inquire what Chriſt is, <hi>What is thy beloved more then another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> &amp;c. What is he more excellent then others, that are called Gods? Surely ther is ſome excellency ſuper-humane in him. <hi>That thou doeſt ſo charge us.</hi> What an excellent thing is it therefore to be earneſt in ſeeking after Jeſus Chriſt? O it winneth ſouls to enter into the conſideration, what Chriſt is, and what excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies there be in him, when they ſee that others be bent, and cannot by no meanes be driven back from ſeeking after him. And therefore know, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, though meane in the world, that with
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:118024:301"/>
earneſtneſſe and meekneſſe doth ſeeke the Lord, he ſhall be a meanes to win others to the ſeeking of him alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That many that profeſſe Chriſt know but little of him. What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> Wherein doth he excell other Lords, that the men of the world doe truſt in? By this anſwer, the daughters of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſeemed to know little of Chriſt. It is true, that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is knowne in Judah, and his name is great in Iſrael, for in Salem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion,</hi> Pſal. 77. 1, 2. yet he is not ſufficiently known among ſome in <hi>Judah,</hi> as he ſhould be, but he ought yet to be better knowne in <hi>Judah,</hi> and his name to be greater in Iſrael. I confes many Chriſtians know Chriſt in the Hiſtory and letter of the Goſpell, many know him after the fleſh, but how few know Chriſt after the Spirit? How few know the dying, reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſcenſion of Chriſt in them? Many know a Chriſt dying upon the Croſſe, without them, but how few know Chriſt within them. Truely I feare, that in many Congregations where the name of Chriſt is profeſſed, there be ſuch ignorant ones among them, which like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> erect an <hi>Altar to the unknowne God,</hi> as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. That is, take upon them to worſhip God whom they know not. But O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! This is not your work, to goe on in blind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but to be <hi>ſtrenthned by the Spirit of God in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man, that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, that being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, what is the bredth, length, depth, height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge; that they may be filled with all the fullneſſe of God,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:118024:301"/>
ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it is an excellent thing for Saints to conferre one with another.</hi> The excellency of holy conference is ſeen here in the Spouſe, comming to the <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> ſpeaking of her beloved, and telling them, that ſhe was <hi>ſick of love,</hi> &amp;c. upon this the daughters of <hi>Jeruſal:</hi> grow very inquiſitive to know more of Chriſt, till at length they begin to be warmed and kindled with the conſideration of his excellency. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Spouſe, <hi>I charge you, if ye find my beloved, to tell him that I am ſick of love,</hi> breeds queſtions in the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem, what is thy beloved,</hi> &amp;c. whence upon the deſcription of her beloved, their hearts are kindled and enflamed with love to Chriſt, and they become earneſt ſeekers of him. Thus it was with the Diſciples, when they were in a damp for the loſſe of Chriſt, after he comes and meets them, and opens the things of the Kingdome of God unto them, <hi>Their hearts begun to burne within them,</hi> Luke 24. 32. We ſhould be very inquiſitive after Chriſt, his wayes, his Kingdome: queſtions many times end in reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the ſoul reſts and injoyes in ſatisfaction. Thus much for the anſwer of the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was by way of queſtion or demand, <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> &amp;c. Now followeth the deſcription which the Spouſe makes of her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and firſt in generall, ſhe deſcribes him thus.</p>

                     <p>The Spouſe deſcribeth Chriſt unto the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by his ſurpaſſing beauty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the end, ſhe may attract and draw forth, both her owne affections, and theirs alſo after him. Chriſt is here ſet forth, as a goodly young man, whoſe image is pourtrayed by his viſible qualities, his colours, and by the members of his body. But this is not meant of the aſpect and face, of the outward lineaments and proportion of his body: although his comelineſſe in that behalfe need not to be doubted of: but of his ſpirituall beauty and gracefulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy,</hi> ſaith ſhe, the mixture of theſe two colours makes a beautifull and good complexion. <hi>White</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> as they ſhew the beſt temparature in man, ſo here it may denote in Chriſt his divine nature, and his humane nature: for <hi>white</hi> is like the appearance of God, as we may ſee in the Viſion in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. he <hi>appeared all white as ſnow, and pure as fine wooll.</hi> And man had his name <hi>Adam,</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damah,</hi> the red mould of the Earth, out of which he was taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. Chriſt is called the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. And was partaker of our fleſh and blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>Or, we may underſtand by Chriſts whiteneſſe, his righteouſneſſe and innocency, as he was without ſpot, without ſin, being the immaculate Lamb, free from all defilements: And thus the Saints are ſaid to be
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:118024:303"/>
cloathed in <hi>white rayment,</hi> which is their <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> Revel. 19. 14. So that theſe words may allude to the <note place="margin">

By which outward beauty is underſtood in ward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And then by his <hi>redneſſe</hi> we may underſtand his bloody ſufferings, for we are ſaid to be waſhed and cleanſed by his blood, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.</p>
                     <p>Againe laſtly, we may underſtand by his <hi>whiteneſſe,</hi> his adminiſtrations, and then it denotes his grace, mercy, meekneſſe, and patience, he is very mild and gentle in all his wayes. And likewiſe by his redneſſe his vengeance and juſtice on his enemies: for he is ſaid to have his <hi>Garments dipt in blood,</hi> Iſa. 63. 1, 2. Now this temparament, and mingling of <hi>white</hi> and <hi>red</hi> after ſuch a myſticall manner in Chriſt, denotes his ſurpaſſing beauty, makes him of high account to his Saints, and enflames their affections to imbrace him, and follow him; for theſe two colours together doe ſhew a right excellent conſtitution of body, and alſo a very perfect beauty. This ruddy or ſanguine complexion is commended in <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 12. And both theſe colours of white and red are joyned together, the whiteneſſe maketh the redneſſe more freſh and faire, and the redneſſe diſcerneth the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from paleneſſe of face, or flegmatick complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: both which colours, if they concurre in any earthly creature, eſpecially ſuch as be young, make the ſame to be moſt of all liked: how much more then ſhould they, conſidered ſpiritually in Chriſt (in

                        <hi>That Chriſt is one in whom is rare beauty.</hi> The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt deſcribes him to be ſo, when he ſays, <hi>Thou art fairer then the Children of Adam,</hi> Pſal. 45. 3. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>beheld his glory as the onely begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,</hi> John 1. 16. By the <hi>onely begotten</hi> is meant, he that came from the boſome of God, with the glory of the Father upon him. And Chriſt in his glory had <hi>his face ſhining as the Sun,</hi> Mat. 17. 2. For he was full of his Fathers glory, <hi>In him dwellt all the fullneſſe of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9. It was God appeared gloriouſly in our fleſh, ſhining forth in his glorious beams through his Sonne: So that Chriſt is glorious by the indwellings of God, by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, wiſdome, power, goodneſſe, glorious in all his offices and adminiſtration, dealing in much meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gentleneſſe with his people, and in as great juſtice and wrath with his enemies. Thus Chriſt is deſcribed poſitively to be all glorious and faire, in that it is ſaid he is <hi>white and ruddy.</hi> It followeth, that his glory is farther ſet forth, comparatively.</p>

of her beloved. Now whence is it that the faith and graces of the Saints are ſo impregnable? whence is it that their hope is ſo indefatigable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vever out of breath? whence is it, that no ſtormes or tempeſts of tentation can breake their ſpirits, and make them give out; but that largeneſſe of affection, that they have towards Chriſt: An example we have in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water;</hi> So it is with the Saints, they refuſe not to venture even upon boiſtrious ſtormes, and dangers to goe to Chriſt.

Now becauſe Chriſt hath not one, but many excellencyes; every thing in him is excellent, inward, and outward; from his head to his feet, &amp;c. for indeed beauty conſiſts not only in colour and complexion, but in affinitie and proportion of all parts.

                     <p>The Spouſe begins to ſet out the excellency of the chiefe part, viz. the <hi>head.</hi> Now the head of Chriſt is God, as the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>That Chriſt is the head of every man, that the man is the head of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that God is the head of Chriſt.</hi> The head hath an eminencie above all other parts, and alſo an influence upon all the Members, wee may underſtand this of God, who is the head of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. or, we may underſtand it of the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt over his Church, that his adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, government, and headſhip is moſt glorious and

                     <p>
                        <hi>As fine gold, or the ſolid gold.</hi> Two names of the beſt gold are here joyned together.

And as gold is precious: ſo it's durable mettall, which ſhews, that Chriſts head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and dignitie is everlaſting and durable, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly, and of a a glorious extent.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>God is the head of Chriſt, and Chriſt is the head of Saints. <hi>In Chriſt were hidden all the treaſures of divine wiſdome, for in him dwelt the fullneſſe of God; he was the expreſſe image of the Fathers perſon, and the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory.</hi> Chriſt lived in the knowledge, counſell, wiſdome, and boſome of the Father, and therefore was an excellent head, a golden head: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he compared to every kind of gold, but to that which is moſt pure and ſolid, he is eminent, glorious, and ſhining in all the excellencies of his father, and doth adminiſter to his Spouſe, that he receives from God: ſo that his Members are golden members, from his influence, who is a golden head: therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches are ſtiled the <hi>ſeven golden candleſticks, Revel.</hi> 1. Every thing in the Tabernacle was gold, to ſhew, that every thing in the Spouſe is excellent. It is moſt certaine, that there is much falſe gold in the
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:118024:306"/>
world: naturall and carnall men have golden ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their owne, but it will be found at the beſt to be but guilt, and externall paintings: but Chriſt only is a head of gold, not only his Crowne gold, but his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head is gold, pure gold, refined, and all gold, and nothing but gold, all ſhining and glorious.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the commendation of Chriſts head.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhe proceedeth to his haire.</p>

So the precious ſtones ſet upon Rings or rows upon the golden Ephod, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 7. had their hollow places in which they were cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet, and ſo were called the <hi>ſtones of fulneſſe,</hi> becauſe they did in ſo fit ſort fill their hollow places. So that as a precious ſtone is made fit for the hollow of the Ring: So the commendation of the eyes is, that they are fitted for the holes of the head. And as ſtones thus fitted and cunningly ſet in the Ring are ſeemly and beautifull, ſo it is a ſpeciall commendation of the eyes of man or woman, to ſtand even; for if the eyes doe ſtand forth too much, it is a deformity, as we uſe to ſay, goggle eyed: and likewiſe if they be ſunk in too deep, then they be, as we uſe to terme them, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low eyed. Now Chriſts eyes are neither of theſe, his pure eyes are as pretious ſtones that are fitly ſet in their places: he is not goggled eyed, his eyes are ſteddy and firme, they be as a ſtone in a gold Ring, which cannot be turned out of their place: his eyes are evermore guiding his ſight to looke perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things, into the depth of mans heart, and into the depth of Gods ſecrets and counſells.</p>

The <hi>Chriſolite</hi> is reported of ſome to be a very rich, precious ſtone, that comes out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> gliſtering as gold, and that 'tis of Sea-green colour.

However we take it, thus much it ſignifies, that all the works of Chriſts hands are moſt rare, precious, and glorious: for we muſt underſtand by his <hi>Hands,</hi> not onely his ſtrength and power, but alſo all his works, becauſe Chriſts power is in the performance of them.

The works of God are pure and beautifull, yea, moſt precious, and that beyond Gold and precious ſtones, yea, more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then numbers of Rings, filled with all manner of precious ſtones. Hence it is, that when <hi>David</hi> would expreſſe the wonderfull works of God, he ſaith, <hi>If I would declare and ſpeake of them, they are more in number then I can expreſſe,</hi> Pſal. 40. 5.

Chriſt is the moſt mercifull, the moſt pittifull, and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate High-Prieſt that ever was: and therefore it was that he was made like unto us, bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, ſubject to hunger, thirſt, cold, wearineſſe, tentation, and the like, as we.

                        <hi>That thoſe that kindle others, muſt be enflamed in their owne hearts.</hi> Thoſe that ſpeak with experience and confidence, doe often make impreſſions upon the hearers. The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in the beginning of his Epiſtle, to perſwade others to imbrace his doctrine, he affirmeth, <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeene with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life,</hi> he delivered to them. That which comes from the heart, often goeth to the heart, and that which comes from the affections, many times reacheth the affections.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>We followed not deceiveable fables, when we preached unto you the power and comming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but with our eyes we ſaw his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16. O beloved! It is an excellent thing to ſpeake of the excellency of Chriſt, from knowledge and experience, and this many Chriſtians can doe: but the watchmen before-mentioned (Chap. 3. 3. &amp; 5. 7.) had no ſuch knowledge or experience, but in them the ſaying was fulfilled, <hi>The Paſtors are become bruitiſh, and have not ſought the Lord, they ſhall not proſper,</hi> Jer. 10. 21.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in that ſhe ſaith, <hi>Whither is thy beloved turned aſide, that we may ſeeke him with thee?</hi> Towit, with thee his Spouſe.</p>

When the two Diſciples went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> they talking together of Chriſt, it came to paſſe, that as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned together, <hi>Jeſus himſelfe drew nigh, and went with them,</hi> Luke 24. 13. Though their eyes were holden for a time that they could not know him, yet after further communication he lodged with them; and ſitting at the Table, at length cauſed their eyes to be open, and he manifeſted himſelfe unto them: And ſo it is in this place, on a ſuddaine it is revealed to the Spouſe, where he is whom ſhe ſeeketh. Thus much for the queſtion propounded by the Daughters of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> Now the reſolution of the Spouſe followeth in the next words.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Garden</hi> of Chriſt is his Church, as in Chap. 4. 16. &amp; 5. 1. The Catholique Church is his <hi>Garden,</hi> and the particular Churches are his Gardens and beds of ſpices, where companies of believers grow, in whoſe hearts are ſowne the precious ſeed of the ſpirit, which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls, <hi>The ſeed of God:</hi> So the Saints become as a bed of ſpices in the Garden, comely, and ſweet ſmelling, in whom Chriſts ſoul delights, as in ſweet ſpices. Now the Spouſe comes to know that Chriſt is in her, he was there preſent all the time of her ſeeking, but ſhe perceived him not, but now he was manifeſt to her. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt is never abſent from his Saints, though they cannot ſometimes diſcerne his preſence.</hi> Chriſt was with his Spouſe when ſhe fainted for want of his preſence, when ſhe was ſick of love, and when ſhe made ſuch a diligent ſearch and enquiry after him, but ſhe diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him not all that while, but now he manifeſteth himſelfe unto her, ſo that now ſhe hath a plaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of him, when ſhe ſaith, <hi>My beloved is gone into his Garden, to the bed of ſpices,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt is neer his Spouſe, as well when ſhe hath not, as when ſhe
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:118024:318"/>
hath the manifeſtation of his preſence. God was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver neerer Chriſt, upholding him by his divine power, then when he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> So the Lord is neare, yea, in the middeſt of his people, afflicting, ſtrengthning, and ſupporting them, when they have little or no ſight, or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his preſence. Secondly Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth not long together hide his divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from his Spouſe.</hi> It is true, he may veile himſelfe for a while, and withdraw his light and comfort from the ſoul; though he take not away his love, yet he may ſuſpend the acts of it: he may ſeem to frowne, and to hide, and ecclipſe himſelfe, that the ſoul for a while looſeth ſence, and feels not its owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now when it is thus with a believer, Chriſt is gone, the comfort and aſſurance of his love is gone, joy, and love, and delight, and all is gone. O how diſconſolate and ſad is the ſoul then: this is very irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the ſoul that is indeared to Chriſt, and deſires his communion: yet notwithſtanding theſe things are but ſhort, Chriſt will not be long abſent from his Saints, his great delight and affection towards them will conſtraine him to manifeſt himſelfe. <hi>Joſeph</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelfe for a while, but he was much ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his ſpirit, untill he had made himſelfe knowne unto his brethren: So it is with Chriſt, he may keep at at a diſtance from his people for a while, but it will not be long before he returne againe, and manifeſt himſelfe unto his Spouſe.

                     <p>Firſt, Chriſts end in going downe into his Garden
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:118024:319"/>
is to <hi>feed there,</hi> that is, to aſſociate himſelfe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with his people in the graces of his owne ſpirit, eating his owne pleaſant fruits, as in Chap. 4. 16. And alſo to Feaſt and refreſh his people with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, giving them of the heavenly Manna to eat, and of the River of life to drinke: he doth impart unto his Saints the graces of his ſpirit: he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his Gardens, <hi>Viz.</hi> All his particular Churches, with all variety of Heavenly dainties.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth aſſociate himſelfe with his people, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfying their ſouls with his ſweetneſſe. He feeds in the Gardens,</hi> by communicating of himſelfe and his glory unto his Saints. You may remember in Chap. 5. 1. Chriſt declares that he had eaten his honey with his honey-comb; and here he feedeth in the Gardens. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſeed his flock like a Shepheard, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his armes, and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young,</hi> Iſa. 40. 11. So that Chriſt doth plentifully, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that with the greateſt care that poſſible can be, feed and refreſh his people. Another place paralell to this, is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>I will feed them in good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures upon the high Mountaines of Iſrael, there ſhall their fold be, there ſhall they lye in a good field, in a fat paſture, I will feed my ſlocke, and cauſe them to lye downe, ſaith the Lord God. I will ſeeke that which was loſt, and bring back that which was driven away; I will bind up that which was broken, and ſtrengthen that which is ſicke, and deſtroy the fat and the ſtrong, and feed them with judgement.</hi> Here is ſtore of all ſupply, yea, ſuitable ſupply for every want: a fit ſalve for every ſoare. Thus we ſee Chriſt doth feed in his Gardens, he doth communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:118024:319"/>
his ſpirit, and makes a comfortable ſupply to all our wants.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſts end in going into his Garden is to <hi>gather Lillies:</hi> that is, to accept the ſweet-ſmelling fruits of his owne graces, growing in his Churches: or, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his people to himſelfe, which are as Lillies among thorns. Chriſtians are compared to <hi>Lillies,</hi> for their purity and whiteneſſe, being cleane through the word, as the Apoſtle ſaith; that is, through Chriſt who is the word. The Lillie, as it is white and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo it is a very tall, goodly plant, therefore the Spouſe is compared to it: Other men are compared to thornes becauſe they are noxious and hurtfull, they are good for nothing but to cumber the ground, and to be offenſive, and to be burned. So the wicked are compared to ſuch, becauſe they are hurtfull and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, but the Saints are compared to Lillies, for beauty and fairneſſe. Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints are beautifull perſons.</hi> Here they are compared to the glorious and beautifull Lillie. God cloatheth Lillies of the field with excellent beauty, their glory is brought into competition with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> whoſe glory came far ſhort of the Lillies white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and beauty; and if God take care for Lillies will he not take care for you, <hi>O yee of little faith?</hi> Mat. 6. 29. Doth God care for Lillies, that are to day, and to morrow are caſt into the Oven, and ſhall he not care for theſe living holy Lillies? Yes, undoubtedly he will. Chriſts argument is undeniable, he that puts ſuch a beauty upon the poore plants, that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to day in the morning, and wither before night, he that puts ſuch beauty upon the graſſe of the field, will he not put more excellency upon his Saints?
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:118024:320"/>
Without queſtion he will. The Saints are as faire, and much fairer in Gods eye, then all the Lillies of the field. The Church is ſaid to be <hi>cloathed with the Sun,</hi> in Revel. 12. 1. That is, ſhe was cloathed with God, and with Chriſt, with the Spirit, with the white robes of his righteouſneſſe, and therefore ſhe muſt needs be glorious. And the Armies in Heaven, which are the Saints that follow Chriſt, are ſaid to be <hi>Cloathed in fine linnen, white and cleane,</hi> Rev. 19. 14. The Saints are a choſen people, to be <hi>holy, and without blame before him in love,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. God looks upon the Saints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, not as concerning the fleſh, and the carnall mind, which is enmity againſt God, but according to the Spirit, and the new man, which is created of God, after his owne image. And thus Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To waſh and cleanſe his Church, by the waſhing of water, and the word, that he might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 26, 27. This is the pure, holy, and glorious condition of the Spouſe. The Saints are Lillies, being cloathed with the white Garments of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any naturall or fleſhly glory of their owne: The whiteneſſe and purity of the Saints is borrowed, as the Moone borrows all her light from the Sunne, ſo the Saints derive their glory and excellency from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in that ſhe ſaith, the end of Chriſts going into his Garden is, <hi>to gather Lillies.</hi> Hence Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt doth graciouſly accept of the fruits of his owne Spirit.</hi> Chriſt planteth a Vineyard, and delighteth to eat the fruit thereof; and ſo in Chap. 4. 16. <hi>Let my beloved come in, and eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi> That is,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:118024:320"/>
let him accept of, and partake of all the fruits of his: owne ſpirit, fruits of union and fruits of communion when Chriſt becomes as a dew upon <hi>Iſrael, Iſrael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his pleaſant plant, and is found to be fruitfull in returns to Chriſt againe: now Chriſt will accept of all thoſe returnes of his owne ſpirit, from his owne people, he comes into his garden to gather Lilies, to accept of the returnes of his owne ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The Spouſe having thus reſolved the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhe begins to feele ſome comfort and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing from Chriſt, who had before eſtranged himſelfe from her, and therefore ſhe now concludeth with a kinde of triumphant acclamation upon all the former paſſages, both of her ill dealing with Chriſt, and Chriſts withdrawing from her: notwithſtanding all former paſſages, ſhe doth as it were glorie in her union and communion with Chriſt, as followeth in the next verſe, whereſhe ſaith.</p>

The cauſe is knowne by the effect, though the cauſe be firſt in being, yet the effect is ſometimes firſt in diſcoverie: ſo it is here, Chriſts love and goodneſſe is the cauſe of ours: yet many times we ſee our owne before wee ſee his. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi> In theſe words you ſee a mutuall intereſt and an owning between Chriſt and his Spouſe, as if the Spouſe had ſaid, as he will not have another, but will content and delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly with me. <hi>Who feedeth among the Lilies;</hi> that is, who liveth moſt pleaſantly and ſweetly, as they that eate their meate among Lilies, and other flowers, cannot but live in pleaſure; but I ſhall not enlarge on this, having ſpoken largely of it in chap. 2. 16.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the former Chapter, and eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end thereof, the Spouſe had very highly commended Chriſt her head, and that not only to ſtirre up others to love, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him that was ſo excellent, but alſo to raiſe up and increaſe the fervencie of her affection towards him: ſo in this Chapter, Chriſt again on the other ſide doth likewiſe exceedingly praiſe her, not only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to expreſſe his great affection towards her, and to let her know, that no love or commendation beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him is loſt, but when that ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:118024:322"/>
to the full: but alſo to draw on others in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection to joyne themſelves unto her, whom both he ſo tenderly loveth, and highly magnifieth.

This indeed may be demanded, leaſt wee might imagine that here is a tedious and a needleſſe repetition. The truth is, that this comendation is not ſuperfluous, but commeth very fitly for the comfort of the Spouſe: for you have ſeene in the beginning of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how unkindly ſhe dealt with Chriſt, how he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe, as one diſpleaſed, ſo that ſhe fell into great affliction, being toſſed to and fro, with doubtings, leaſt Chriſt for her unkinde dealing, ſhould utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her, ſhe bewaileth her offence, and ſeeketh after her beloved with much ſorrow and trouble: and now leaſt it might ſeeme; that by her offence, or by her affliction ſhe had loſt that former beautie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, yea, leaſt there might ſeeme to remaine ſome blot, or that her former liking was diminiſhed, he doth give her the ſame, or rather greater commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations then before, and this is the reaſon, why Chriſt doth renew the commendations of his Spouſe, becauſe in the former Chapter the Spouſe was full of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, griefe and ſickneſſe, for her negligence and careleſneſſe towards her beloved, now he comforteth and aſſureth her, that notwithſtanding the ſame, ſhe is and ſhall be as deare unto him, as ever ſhe ſame, ſhe was before: which thing alſo that ſhee might be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of, he doth give her a large and unfeigned commeudation.</p>

In the laſt place, leaſt ſhe ſhould feare, that Chriſt having once forſaken her, might forſake her againe, he excuſeth his abſence from her heretofore, by which he in her ſence and feeling only to have forſaken her, when as indeed he was neere unto her, and this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the reſidue of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And thus much being ſaid, both for the connection and diviſion of the Chapter, into the chiefe parts and members, we come now to the ſenſe of the words of the text as they lye:</p>

                  <div type="phrase">

                     <p>Chriſt having met with his Spouſe, who laboured and ſought to finde him, doth after the manner of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, declaring his great affections, marveilouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her beauty: wee muſt underſtand this in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſenſe, for the Spouſe hath no beauty, but ſhe receives it from Chriſt: ſo that Chriſt doth but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his owne beautie in the Spouſe. Now as this reſpects Chriſt, it propoundeth unto us the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his unfeined and continuall love towards his Spouſe. Or if we reſpect the Spouſe herſelfe, then this commendation is for her comfort; as if Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:118024:323"/>
ſay, thinke not that that ſurpaſſing beauty of thine is decayed, or that I have caſt off my love and liking towards thee, by reaſon of thy former diſcourteſies, and negligence, I doe not diſdaine and ſcorne thee for thy ſpots, and defilements, but as I ſaid before, in chap. 4. 1, 2. So I even now affirme the ſame ſtill, thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and thy favour is moſt acceptable and delightfull to me.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve, firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt's love towards his Saints, is a beautifull, and continuall love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt doth not ſometimes love, and ſometimes hate, <hi>but whom he loves once, he loves to the end.</hi> Although the Saints offend Chriſt often, yet he loves them ſtill: he only purges them, and heales them of their ſpirituall maladies, which cannot be done without ſome ſmart; but he doth not a whit leſſen, or detract his love from them, though his people come upon him every day for new favours and new ſupplyes; yet his goodneſſe is never wearied or tired out. The love of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Saints never decayes or waxeth cold, like the ſtone <hi>Asbeſtos,</hi> of which <hi>Solinus writes of,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once hot, it can never be cooled againe. The love of Chriſt is like a fountaine overflowing, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Jul. Solin. Poly hiſtor.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts love towards his Saints, is not only everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, but an exceeding great and magnificent love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here behold the greatneſſe of the love of Chriſt, who doth quite forget all offences committed againſt

him, as if they had never been, he doth not ſo much as once upbraid his Spouſe for her unkinde dealing; it's without queſtion the Saints having experience how ſweet the Lord is being made partakers of his great benefits, when the fleſh prevailes upon them, are much diſmayed, fearing that now they cannot be beautifull and deare in his ſight. Now they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelves, how ſhould he love, and delight in them? Here is therefore a ſpeciall comfort miniſtred, that thoſe breathing after his preſence, he doth refreſh them, he doth imbrace them, he doth love them, he doth commend them, and delight in them, even as if they had never done evill againſt him: what a ſweet gracious and exceeding love is here? who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the riches of this grace, who can be able any way to ſet forth this bountifulneſſe of the Lord?</p>

                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>Comely as Jeruſalem.</head>
                     <p>As for the beauty of this City, we have it much commended in Scripture, where it is called the <hi>praiſe of the whole Earth,</hi> Iſa. 62. 7. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 3. &amp; 48. 2, 3, &amp;c. It was the place where the Lord choſe to dwell, and had his Temple built there, on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Church under the New Teſtament is called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> holy, and heavenly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides forreigne Writers report it to be the moſt famous <note place="margin">See <hi>Plln. Hiſt. Lib. 5. cap.</hi> 14.</note> City in the <hi>Eaſt. Jeruſalem</hi> ſignifies in the Hebrew, the ſight of peace. Thus we ſee the beauty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Spouſe ſet out unto us by Earthly ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. And though it be true indeed, that none of theſe things can ſufficiently declare the ſame unto us, yet we may perceive that the Scripture hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken the moſt excellent things of the Land of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but of the whole world, to ſet forth the ſame unto us, that ſo under theſe earthly reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he might the better make us (who are very groſs
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:118024:325"/>
and dull) to conceive of heavenly and ſpirituall things. Now in that the beauty, glory, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Spouſe is ſet forth by theſe two pleaſant and famous Cities, which were both places of renown. So then, comparing the Spouſe to <hi>Tirzah,</hi> which was the Kings Pallace, it is as much as if he had ſaid, I will dwell in my Church, I will be neer her, and make her the place of my reſidence. And as for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhe is not onely commended for her ſanctity, that ſhe is the holy City, but alſo for her peace and glory above other places. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Spouſe is made glorious by the preſence of Chriſt, and by that peace and tranquillity that accompanies the ſame.</hi> The Spouſe is glorious by the preſence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellings of Chriſt; this appears in that it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath choſen Sion to be an Habitation for himſelf, he hath longed for her, this ſhall be my reſt for ever, herewill I dwell, for I have delight herein,</hi> Pſal. 122. 14, 15. When the Lord comes to reſide in the ſoul, to delight, and take up his reſt there, to advance his Scepter, and reign there, how glorious and beautifull muſt the reign there, how glorious and beautifull muſt the ſoul needs be. Againe it's ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath choſen Jacob to himſelfe, and Iſrael for his owne Poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 135. 4. Meaning his Church, not onely of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Gentills.</hi> And the glory and peace of the Spouſe is figured out by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>She is builded like a City which is at unity within her ſelfe, thither the Tribes goe up, even the Tribes of the Lord, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto Iſrael, and to give thanks unto the name of the Lord; there is the ſeat of judgement, even the ſeat of the houſe of David: peace be within thy walls,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 122. 3, 4. So that here he doth promiſe inward and outward peace, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>As many as
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:118024:325"/>
walk according to this rule, peace ſhalbe unto them, &amp; mercy, and to the Iſrael of God,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. There can be nothing but peace, goodneſſe, delight and glory, where Chriſt doth inhabite. Thus much for Chriſts aſſuring the Spouſe of his love, by deſcribing of her beauty: Now followeth his commendations of her fortitude and ſtrength.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="phrase">
                     <head>Terrible as an Army with banners.</head>
                     <p>In theſe words the valour and fortitude of the Spouſe is ſet forth; but one would thinke that this ſhould be no great commendations, eſpecially becauſe the Church is reſembled to a woman; neither doth it agree to that ſex, neither is it praiſe-worthy in them, (as ſome ſuppoſe) to ſtrike terrour into others. But for anſwer, its commendable for a woman, even by her gravity and ſobriety, to ſtrike terrour and feare into ſuch as would make them diſloyall to their husbands, which thing might aptly agree to the Spouſe here, and that in a double reſpect; to wit,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When as in reſpect of her Majeſty, ſhe ſo terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her adverſaries, eſpecially falſe teachers, ſuch as would corrupt her by falſe doctrine. Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When as in regard of her diſobedient Children, ſhe woundeth them by the word and diſcipline for a while; neither doth the Lord meane this onely, by reſembling his Spouſe to <hi>Armies with many Enſignes or banners,</hi> but alſo to ſet out unto us thereby, the good order and invincible force of the ſame. Hereby Chriſt doth ſtrengthen his Spouſe inwardly againſt temptations and the fleſh: for as it is an impoſſible thing to prevaile upon an Army, conſiſting of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and valiant people: ſo it is as hard, yea, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:118024:326"/>
impoſſible to prevaile againſt the Church, ſhe is of ſuch ſtrength, power, and courage, that though ſhe may be aſſaulted, yet ſhe can never be overcome.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints are full of fortitude and valour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Spouſe is commended for one that is <hi>terrible as an Army with banners:</hi> and in Chap. 1. ſhe is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Troop of Horſes in the Charriots of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſhe is ſtrong and prompt to the battaile: for ſhe is as one that hath put on the whole armour of God, ſhe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſpirituall battaile, and putteth her enemies to flight. The ſtrength of the Church was typified in that ſpeech where it is ſaid, when Iſrael abode in his Tents, according to their Tribes, encamping in the Wilderneſſe, his Tents were goodly, his ſtrength was as an Unicornes, he couched as a couragious Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom none durſt ſtir up, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 2. 5. Thus we ſee why he ſaith ſhe is terrible as an Army with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: an Army that is ſtrong, and marcheth with Banners or Enſignes, is very terrible to their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to behold; even ſo is the Spouſe unto the whole Army of ſpirituall enemies: but we muſt note, that the Saints are not thus ſtrong of themſelves, but in the power of God, in the power of the ſpirit. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth, that we ſtand in the invincible power of his, by putting on the whole Armour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. Thus Chriſt commendeth his Spouſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: Now followeth his particular commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her in the next words.</p>

                     <head>For they have overcome me.</head>
                     <p>In the Hebrew theſe words run thus, <hi>For they have lifted me up:</hi> that is, they have lifted me up with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and courage, and ſtrength, &amp;c. as in <hi>Pſa. 138. 3.

So Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the ſame ſtrength and power of love, to be in him toward her, that ſo ſhe might know there was no love loſt, and therefore he uſeth another ſpeech, but to the ſame effect, when he ſaith, that ſhe had pluckt away his heart with one of her eyes, Chap. 4. 9. That is, ſhe, with the beauty, ſimplicity, and chaſtity of her eyes, had even won his heart; it expreſſeth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:118024:327"/>
affection of love towards her. Even ſo in this place, the beauty of her eyes doth affect him in a wonderfull manner. Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the beauty of the Spouſe is exceeding great in Chriſts eyes.</hi> Here he doth very highly commend the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beauty of the eye of faith, and that in ſuch a kind of ſpeech that doth in the higheſt ſort that can be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe how much the beauty of her eyes doth delight him: for even, as ſhe ſaid before, ſhe was ſick of love, ſo he ſaith here, that he is, as it were, overcome with love. Faith is the eye of the ſoul, and how excellent is the beauty thereof in the eyes of the Lord, yea, it doth as it were, raviſh, and overcome him with the ſight thereof. Thus much for the commendations of her Eyes: That of her Haire followeth.</p>

                     <p>The birth, or honour touching the parentage of Queenes, and the beautie and deckings of Concubines, and Virgines, is great and highly eſteemed in the world, but it is not comparable to the honour, beautie, and rich ornaments of the Spouſe, ſhe ſtandeth alone in all excellency. It is a thing of great account in the world, to be daughter of a mighty Prince: but what is the dignitie of their birth, if it be compared with the dignitie and honour of the birth of the Spouſe? It is a divine and heavenly birth, the Saints are borne of God, and receive honour from him. The Spouſe is the only one of her mother, to wit, <hi>Jeruſalem that is from
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:118024:332"/>
above,</hi> who is the mother of all the Saints in the world, and unto none elſe, all that be the Children of the moſt high. Thus wee ſee, how for dignitie and honour in birth, ſhe farre excelleth all the Queenes in the world. But now the Spouſe is not only excellent to Chriſt, as a Dove, undefiled, and his only one, and that ſhe is one, pure, and choſen of her Mother, the heavenly <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> but alſo ſhe is excellent to others that be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as appeares in the next words.</p>

<pb n="655" facs="tcp:118024:333"/>
nor to the dawing of the day, or day breake, but even to the glory and beauty of the morning it ſelfe. As the morning is comfortable after the dark night, ſo is the divine preſence of Chriſt to the ſoul, after the dark night of ſin, ignorance, and affliction.</p>

Chriſt ſhined in the glory of his Father, and the Saints ſhine in the glory of Chriſt: they receive all their grace and light from him. <hi>Of his fullneſſe we all receive, and grace for grace,</hi> John 1. 16. As Chriſt lived in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſome, and councell, acted in his power, and ſtood in his righteouſneſſe: So the Saints live in the ſecrets of the Almighty, and partake of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in Chriſt, they ſhine in the ſame glory &amp; excellency as Chriſt did. But now the Moon, though ſhe be cleare and receive much light from the Sun, yet ſometimes the light and glory of the Sunne is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed from her: neither is ſhe ſo perfectly cleare, but ſometimes ſhe hath ſpots, therefore it is not only ſaid, that the Spouſe is faire as the Moone, but it's added,</p>

                     <p>Here are the degrees of grace, the Spouſe is made partaker of; her firſt light is like the morning, or

The Spouſe is called a Garden, <hi>I went downe to the Garden.</hi> And here it is Tranſlated, <hi>The Garden of Nuts,</hi> being generally ſo taken by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Rabbies.

And ſo I ſay we may take it, <hi>I went downe into the dreſſed Garden,</hi> for by this ſpeech may be underſtood all the coſt and labour which the Lord beſtowed upon his Vineyard, by planting, watering, dreſſing, and beſtowing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of labour and coſt upon it, that it might be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: In this the Lord ſhewed that he did not out of loathſomneſſe and wrath deſert from his Spouſe, but rather of a very earneſt deſire that he had to finiſh the heavenly marriage betweene them, and therefore he comes down to make her as a well-dreſſed Garden.</p>

                     <p>The Hebrew <hi>Amminadab</hi> ſignifieth <hi>my willing people,</hi> or, <hi>my princely and noble people:</hi> that is, As they that be my bounteous, noble, and free, hearted people, do the things that they doe cheerefully, and therefore with the more expedition and ſpeed then others: ſo I came cheerefully, and with a ready mind, after I had once reſolved upon the matter, to ſee and comfort my Spouſe.

                        <hi>When Chriſt comes to raiſe his people out of a low and darke condition, he comes with power, ſtrength and ſpeed. My ſoule made me like the Chariots,</hi> &amp;c. Chariots are for ſtrength and ſpeed. Chriſt comes to comfort and ſupport, as with Chariots.</p>

                  <p>IN the former verſe, Chriſt declared his earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and willingneſſe to viſit, and comfort his people, which thing is made more manifeſt here in this verſe, by the deſcription he maketh of his recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, and of the effects following.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, By the Epithite Chriſt is pleaſed to give his Spouſe, calling her <hi>Shulamite,</hi> which is from her peace and perfection.</p>
                  <p>As for the matter, it is, that the Spouſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her former feeling and comfort in Chriſt, and this is declared by the end, to wit, <hi>That we may look upon thee,</hi> that Chriſt &amp; his friends, may behold the beautie and glorie of the Spouſe.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are the words of Chriſt, unto his Spouſe, who in ſeeking of him, had, as one would ſay, gone beyond him.

                     <p>When Chriſt commeth and calleth at the doores of our hearts, he will take no deniall, he will not be put off with any delayes or denials whatſoever: but makes his voice to be heard, and cals aloud, untill we heare, and returne unto him.

The friends of the Bride are her fellow-members, whom ſhe would make partakers with her ſelfe, to behold the majeſty and glory of Chriſt her head.

                     <p>By the noſe then we may in the firſt place under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the courage and ſtrength of the Spouſe, and that ſhe was carefull to defend her ſelfe and Members, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her enemies.

the pride of the wicked is ſet forth by the haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Noſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. ſignifying his lofty, ſtout, and proud carriage; and on the contrary, when the threatning to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſaith, he would take away her <hi>noſe and her eares, &amp;c.

                  <p>FIrſt, here's the commendations of the <hi>head:</hi> Some read it, <hi>Thy head upon thee:</hi> Others, <hi>In thine head:</hi> we may take it either for the <hi>head</hi> it ſelfe (which is Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22.) or it may be taken for the <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon the head, namely thoſe graces wherewith Chriſt hath adorned his Spouſe.

                     <p>The word <hi>Carmell</hi> is commonly taken for a place full of paſtures, ſet alſo with Trees, whereof it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this place had it's name: <hi>Carmell</hi> was the name of the Mountaine where <hi>Elias</hi> killed <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, and praid for raine, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 19, 20. It ſeemed to be a very fruitfull place, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 4. For a fruitfull place oppoſed to a barren Wilderneſſe, is called <hi>Carmell.</hi> Iſa. 32. 15. And Chap. 29. 17.

The meaning is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Church in her former dark and low condition, was like a waſt wilderneſſe, but when the Lord ſhould ſhine upon her with more light and glory, ſhe ſhould become a moſt plentifull and beautifull place, even as <hi>Carmell</hi> and <hi>Sharon.</hi> The Hebrew <hi>Carmell</hi> is ſometimes taken for <hi>Crimſon,</hi> or Scarlet-colour, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 14. ſuch colours were worne of Princes and great perſons, meaning thereby, that her head was adorned with that which was coſtly and full of majeſty, as that colour is; but the other Interpretation ſeems to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

a <hi>flock of Goats,</hi> that was ſmooth and faire: So here it's likened to purple, deare and coſtly, it being the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beautifull attire of great ones. <hi>Purple</hi> differs not much (as ſome think) from <hi>Scarlet,</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they reconcile the Evangeliſts. <hi>Matthew</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Chap. 27. 28. that they put upon Chriſt a <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Robe.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 19. 2.

                  <p>THis admiration of the Spouſes beauty and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe in all parts, ſheweth the ground of the former ſpeech, why the King is held in his <hi>Galleries,</hi> foraſmuch as he was ſo exceedingly raviſhed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the beauty and glory of his Spouſe.

Love,</hi> or <hi>O my love, how faire art thou, and how pleaſant art thou in every reſpect, in all parts, or rather in all thoſe heaped up together in one?</hi> For as you ſee, he hath gone by particulars from the foot to the head. Firſt, he commendeth her goings, as with ſhooes: then he likeneth the joynts of her Thighs to Jewells, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. After this he mentioneth the Navell, which he compares to a round cup that wanteth not liquour. And her bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an heap of wheat compaſſed about with Lillies. Her two Breaſts are as two young Roes that are Twins. And ſo he aſcendeth, and ſaith, her Neck is as a Tower of Ivory: her eyes like the fiſh-pools of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> by the gate of <hi>Bath-rabbim.</hi> Her Noſe as the Tower of <hi>Lebanon</hi> that looketh toward <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> her Head like Scarlet, and her haire like the Purple, whereby the King is held in his Galleries. In ſumme, her beauty is wonderfull in all parts, ſhe is comely throughout. True beauty conſiſts in the ſymetrie and conſent of all parts: if there be a comely and pleaſant face and not a comely body: or if there be a comely body, but not ſo well favoured a face: or if the face and body be both comely, and yet ſome defect in one part or other, there is not a compleat beauty. But there is no ſuch kind of deformity in the Spouſe, for ſhe is beautifull in every part, ſhe is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and full of glory.

meaning hereby, that ſhe was full of all manner of delight and pleaſure: ſhe was wholly, and every part and piece of her, together with all her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and attires, or whatſoever did generally or particularly belong unto her, was glorious, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſweet, pleaſant, beautifull, comely, delightfull, &amp;c.

The Lord doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow many goodly things upon his Spouſe, he doth deck her with many rich ornaments, every one of which is to be wondred at for excellency, then how much more when they come alltogether? The glorie of the Spouſe is the more excellent, if wee conſider the perſon that doth thus admire her beautie: and that is Chriſt himſelfe, who cannot admire any low thing: lay all the glorie of Kings before him, and it is, but droſſe, he cannot wonder thereat: for what is that to his owne glorie and excellency, with which the Saints are cloathed? what is the glorie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the Sunne, the Moone and Starres unto him? doth he wonder at them? Surely he wondereth at the glory and beautie of his Spouſe, how excellent then is her beautie and glorie: wee account thoſe earthly things very rare and excellent, that Princes upon earth doe wonder at; how much more rare and

                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt doth not only wonder at, but exceedingly affect and delight in the beautie and glorie of his Saints.</hi> He doth not only call her <hi>faire</hi> and <hi>pleaſant;</hi> but he alſo cals her his <hi>love,</hi> and not only his <hi>love,</hi> but his love in pleaſures, or in delights, or in the things which we eſteeme as dainties.

We know men may love things, and take delight in them, but there be degrees in their love: they may love things very well, yet that is the higheſt, when they take their chiefe pleaſure and delight in that which they love: So Chriſt ſheweth here, that he taketh delight and pleaſure in the beautie of his Spouſe, ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precious and amiable in his ſight.

In ſumme, this is Chriſts meaning, that he will goe up into the palm-tree, that is joyn himſelf to his Spouſe, (who before was reſembled to the ſame) and will take hold of her boughes: to the end he may prune and dreſſe her, that ſhe may bring forth abundance of fruit, ſuch as Chriſt himſelfe may accept of.</p>

<pb n="705" facs="tcp:118024:358"/>
ſtrong that it quickneth up the heavy ſenſes, and doth after a ſort, as it were, refreſh the mind, even of thoſe that are aſleep. This manner of ſpeech, though, as we reſpect the ſimilitude, it may ſeeme hiperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or very exceſſive, yea, more then true, yet if we reſpect the ſpirituall meaning, we ſhall find it is truth it ſelfe: for what is Chriſts purpoſe here, but that his Spouſe ſhould be filled with the fullneſſe of God, whereby ſhe ſhould be able to ſpeake of the things of God, in ſuch power and delightfullneſſe of ſpeech, that it ſhall raiſe men up from the dead: not onely from naturall death, but from the ſleep of death and ſin.

See Chap. 5. 15.) this excellency is pleaſing to Chriſt, it is as wine for the <hi>beloved,</hi> it is ſuch wine as the Spouſe can commend to her beſt friend, it is ſuch as goeth downe ſtraightly, or in righteouſneſſe: it is ſo pure it allureth all that ſeeth it, to drinke of the ſame. This wine is the <hi>immortall ſeed,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23. it is the <hi>power of God to ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16.

When ſinners are awakened by the internall word of the Goſpell, it's ſaid, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14. And ſo it's prophecyed, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, with my dead body ſhall they ariſe, awake and ſing yee that dwell in the duſt,</hi> Iſa. 26. 19. And thus the <hi>dead bones</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to be raiſed at the Prophecy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. And not onely dead men that are aſleep, but thoſe that are ancient, having their ſenſes dulled, and are very ſlow to ſpeak, this wine ſhall revive the ſpirits of the aged, or ſuch as are in a ſtate of ſecurity (as the Spouſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth her ſelfe in Song 5. 2.) are inabled by this ſpirituall wine, to ſpeake, yea, <hi>The Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing, for in the wilderneſſe ſhall breake forth waters, and ſtreams in the deſart, Iſa.</hi> 35. 6. when the Saints are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ſtreams of living waters, and made drunk with the ſpirituall wine of the Kingdome of God, then they ſhall ſing forth the praiſe of God.

                     <p>The conjunction of the words may be taken thus, <hi>Seing,</hi> or <hi>becauſe his affection is towards me.</hi> For in the firſt clauſe of the ſentence ſhe conſecrateth her ſelfe wholly unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>I am my beloveds,</hi> and in the latter clauſe ſhe rendereth a reaſon, ſaying, <hi>Becauſe his affection is towards me.</hi> His kindneſſe towards me wrought this effect, that ſhe and all hers ſhall be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto him.

                     <p>Here the Spouſe then, as full of the wine of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and conſolation from the Lord, teſtifieth her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in him, and that ſhe doth in the right of a ffiance and marriage belong unto him, in that ſhe ſaith, <hi>I am my beloveds.</hi> And the ground of it is, <hi>For his deſire is

towards me.</hi> That is, he doth deſire me, and in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection moſt tenderly love me It is as if the Spouſe had ſaid, there is a mutuall love between us, as I love him, ſo he loveth me, as I belong to him, ſo he belongs to me, his love is the ground of mine, and my love to him is the effect of his love. Hence Note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the manifeſtation of Chriſts love to us, is the cauſe of our love unto him.</hi> His love is as the cauſe preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our love as the effect following after: Thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> teſtifieth ſaying, <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> The Spouſe declareth the ſame here, the ſumme of her ſpeech being thus much in effect, ſeing my beloved hath ſet his affections ſo upon me, &amp; freely loved me when I was loſt, and an enemy to him, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. when dead in ſin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. when I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abominable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. yea, that his affection was towards me ſo, as that he hath called me into the neereſt fellowſhip with himſelfe, and doth ſweetly imbrace me not withſtanding all my fleſhly actings; is there not cauſe why I ſhould be his? Such abundant love doth cauſe love againe. As the deſire of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is towards her huſband, and the deſire of a man towards his wife: ſo Chriſts love and affection is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Spouſe, her deſire is alſo towards him.

The caſe is altered with the Spouſe now, from what it was, when ſhe was aſleep in fleſhly ſecurity, and was loath to be raiſed up: even when the fleſh had ſo much prevailed upon her, then theſe things of Chriſt, theſe holy breathings out after him ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to lie buried: but now when the Spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and raiſeth her, herheart is drawn off from fleſhly glorie and proſperity, and ſhe deſireth to lodge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinurlly with Chriſt in the large field of heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Now the Spouſe is ſweetly imbracing of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heavenly things, now ſhe can ſtay among thoſe heavenly joyes and comforts of her beloved.

as you heard before, he and his Saints are one body, and hence it is, that when Saints are begotten unto God, <hi>Chriſt is formed</hi> in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. and as they are nouriſhed by the ſincere milke of the word, ſo is Chriſt alſo nouriſhed, &amp; grows more &amp; more in ſtature and fullneſſe. For that which is properly the perſon of the Saint, or the Saint-ſhip it ſelfe, is part of Chriſt: Chriſt is diffuſed into all his Saints, and they all make but one compleat body, and therefore as the body is ſaid to ſuck the breaſts of ſpirituall conſolation, Chriſt may alſo be ſaid to ſuck thoſe breaſts, for it is Chriſt in the Saints that is nouriſhed: ſo when the Saints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, it is the increaſings of the Lord, and the growth of the Saints is the growth of Chriſt.</p>

This ſhew; the readineſſe and willingneſſe of the Spouſe, both to goe forth and meet, and alſo to wellcome and entertaine Chriſt, it noteth her dilligence and care to find, and to retaine Chriſt, as in Song 3. 2. 4.</p>

                     <p>To <hi>Kiſſe</hi> is a ſigne of honour, love, and obedience, as was noted in Song 1. 2. and the meaning is, that the Spouſe would neither be aſhamed, or afraid to perform the office of love and affection towards him, neither ſhould any contemne or ſcorne her: that is, either they ſhould not ſcorne her, having obtained her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:118024:367"/>

                        <hi>That it is an honourable action, and worthy of much praiſe to entertaine and imbrace Chriſt.</hi> It is true, the world is apt to vex, ſcorne, and contemne the Saints, but yet they are never aſhamed to owne Chriſt: but ſhe doth meet, kiſſe, and imbrace him, even in the open ſtreets. But though the blind world ſhould contemne the Saints, yet the Lord will honour them that honour him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 30. And if any man ſerve Chriſt, <hi>him will the Father honour,</hi> John 12. 26. The Saints ſhall appeare in the brightneſſe of Chriſts glory, which is far above the contempt of the world, and being thus cloathed, they are not afraid or aſhamed of Chriſt, of profeſſing his name and truth, in the open ſtreets of the world.

                     <p>Here the Spouſe alludeth to the cuſtome in thoſe dayes, which was to bring the Bride and Bidegroome alſo, into the houſe of either of their Parents: See <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 97. where <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ſaid to have brought <hi>Rebeckah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tent of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Mother. It is the manner of the Hebrews (as hath been noted heretofore in this Song) to call ſome whole thing or body, by the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, and the parts derived from the ſame, by the names of Sonnes and Daughters. So here, Chriſt and the Saints, making up one Church or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is called the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which commeth downe from God, out of which Chriſt and all Saints ſpring: this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called the <hi>Mother of us all,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26.

In that he alone teacheth by the light of his Spirit. But the Church (who is the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Mother of us all) doth as an inſtrument teach, and inſtruct her particular Members with the heavenly doctrine of the Goſpell. We may take it that ſhe ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach me,</hi> for ſo runs the new Covenant, <hi>That every man ſhall not teach his neighbor, ſaying know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. So that the Saints ſhould not depend upon mans teaching, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt's the true Prophet.</p>

                     <p>This was the end of the Spouſe, in bringing Chriſt in to her mothers houſe, namely, that he might teach and inſtruct her by his Spirit.

                     </p>
                     <p>As it is written of Chriſt love, that nothing can ſeparate his people from it: ſo here the Spouſe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that her love towards him cannot be put out; wee may obſerve the frame of the Spouſes ſpeech ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her former cocmpariſon, when ſhe ſaid, <hi>The coales thereof are coales, and the fire of the flame of God:</hi> for what fire is there, but many waters will quench, at leaſt if floods of waters doe overflow it? but this heavenly fire cannot be quenched, the floods cannot put it out.

                        <hi>If a man would give all his ſubſtance:</hi> as ſilver, gold, all wealth and riches, it could not purchaſe this love; neither could the love of theſe, winne the heart of the Spouſe from Chriſt, for ſhe affirmeth here, that if all treaſures ſhould be offered her, to draw her love from Chriſt, ſhe would utterly contemne them. So that if any man did thinke either to buy this love of her, or

                        <hi>It would utterly be contemned,</hi> or as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>In contemning they would contemne it.</hi> that is, they would certainly contemne it, or it would be altogether wholly contemned; for this is the manner of the Hebrew tongue, when they highly promiſe to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and when they highly diſpraiſe, to double the word alſo: See chap. 1. verſ. 1. In ſumme, ſhe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by this verſe, namely, to declare, that her love was ſo firme and faſt to Chriſt, that it could not be be rent or pulled from her to any other, either by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny force, or by fraud: nor by flatterie or faire promiſes.</p>
                     <p>Hence Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That worldly riches cannot purchaſe divine love, nor get it away from thoſe that have it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the treaſures, and pleaſures, and credit, which the ſubſtance of any mans houſe may procure, ſhall be of no reckoning, either to get or purchaſe the love of Chriſt, or to withhold the Saints from loving him. The Spouſe doth ſo ſet her heart upon Chriſt, that ſhe deſires to be neere him, in his heart, upon his arme: yea, ſhe doth ſo deſire him, that ſhe contemneth all other things in compariſon of him: for, what is the glorie, and the pompe, the riches, and honours, and the pleaſures of the world unto her, more then vile droſſe in compariſon of Chriſt? The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is much addicted to love riches, and the treaſures of this world: yet there is not any thing of ſuch force, to winne the heart from Chriſt; but the Spouſe here affirmeth, that if all treaſures ſhould be offered her to draw her love from Chriſt, ſhe would
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:118024:379"/>
utterly contemne them. And as the Saints cannot be drawne off from the love of Chriſt, by any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good: ſo no earthly treaſure can get on purchaſe this love, for the gifts of the Spirit cannot be bought with money, it being the free gift of God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows at his owne pleaſure, Act. 8. 18, 19, 20. And ſo it's ſaid of wiſdome, that it cannot be gotten for gold, neither ſhall ſilver be weighed for its price, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 15.</p>
                     <p>Now a little to recapitulate. How excellent is this divine love? which carries ſuch an excellent deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and denomination with it.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, That its as ſtrong as death, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it's jealouſie, which is love infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and therefore cruell as the grave, the bed of darkeneſſe, which is called <hi>Sheal,</hi> becauſe it all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes craveth, and is never ſatisfied, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Its hot as the fire, which not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, but alſo burneth all things which ſtand againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Its everlaſting, and victorious in all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and ſufferings, that no troubles, terrours, nor perſecutions can quench it, though whole floods of water were caſt upon it.</p>

                  <p>THe Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was at that time when this Song was written a <hi>wall,</hi> or indeed a City, the glorious City of the great King, and Breaſts ſhe had to nouriſh her Children, and the Lord dwelt in the midſt of her as in his Pallace: but ſhe ſpeaketh here rather of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> according to the promiſe of Chriſt to them, for when thoſe things ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as was promiſed, then they would be a glorious City, and her Breaſts would

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Spouſe is Chriſts Vineyard.</hi> The houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was the Lords <hi>Vineyard, Iſa. 5. 7.</hi> but of this we have ſpoken before in this Song.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſts Vineyard is a fruitful Vineyard.</hi> King
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:118024:388"/>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> was excellent in all things, and therefore his Vineyard could not be but fruitfull, and it being Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in <hi>Baal-hamon,</hi> a fertile ſoyle, by this is noted the fruitfullneſſe of Chriſts Vineyard. Thirdly Obſerve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt injoys all the fruit of his owne Vineyard.</hi> And this is held forth to us in the diſſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Solomons</hi> Vineyard and Chriſts. <hi>Solomon</hi> was forc't to give away the fifth part of the profit to his Keepers, but Chriſt doth reap all the fruit of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Saints, all the fruits of the Spirit, as praiſe and thankſgiving, redound unto him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt keeps the Vineyard of his Church in his owne hands.</hi> As he hath the whole fruits of it, ſo his eyes are alwayes upon it for good. Chriſt appeared in the midſt of the ſeven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, which are the ſeven Churches, <hi>Revel. 1.</hi> Chriſt is alwayes himſelfe in his Vineyard, to dreſſe it, and to prune it, and to make every Vine proſper. Let none therefore thinke they have the domination over the Church, Chriſt onely is Lord and head, he ſtands in need of no Vicar or Vice-gerent, which is one in the ſtead to doe that which Chriſt ſhould doe if he were preſent: this is Antichriſt that takes the very office of Chriſt, which is to ſway in his Church alone.</p>
                     <p>But it may be demanded, doth not Chriſt let forth his Vineyard to Dreſſers? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> plant, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> water? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, That the Prophets and Apoſtles as they were annointed to office and dignity, they were in ſome fort called the dreſſers of Chriſts Vine, but yet no fart her but as inſtruments whom Chriſt uſeth; for he is preſent with them, and in them, he worketh by
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:118024:389"/>
them, and therefore he holdeth the ſeven Starres in his right hand, which are the Angells of the ſeaven Churches, <hi>Revel. 1.</hi> The Keepers of <hi>Solomons</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard doe keep it in his abſence, but the Keepers of Chriſts Vine can doe nothing unleſſe he be with them, and worke by them. Chriſt then will take care of his Church, and take it ſo into his owne hands at laſt, that even <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and the Dragon that is in the Sea ſhall be ſlaine, and in that day his Spouſe ſhall ſing, <hi>A Vineyard of new wine, Iſa. 27. 1, 2.</hi> the Lord will keep it, and water it every moment, leaſt any hurt it, he will keep it night and day, and at laſt free his Church from both it's oppreſſions, and oppreſſors. All this ſhews how precious and how deare the Spouſe was to Chriſt, that he keepeth it himſelfe, and how faithfull the Spouſe is to him, that doth bring forth her fruits to none but him. Chriſt having thus declared the care he had over his Church, he now layeth a charge on her in the Verſe following.</p>

Hence Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Office of the Church and Saints to preach and publiſh Chriſt.</hi> This the Apoſtle exhorteth unto when he ſaith, <hi>Let the word of God dwell in you plentifully, in all wiſdome, teaching and admoniſhing your ſelves in Pſalms and Hymmes, and ſpirituall Songs, ſinging with grace in your hearts, unto the Lord,</hi> Col. 3. 16. This preaching of Chriſt is a ſpecial argument of the love of the Spouſe unto her members, as appears by the words of Chriſt, when he ſaith, <hi>Peter loveſt thou me, feed my Lambs,</hi> John 21. 15. As if he ſhould ſay, this is a great fruit of thy love which I require, preach me to my people. So the Spouſe profeſſing that great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her love to Chriſt, a little before in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Chriſt requireth that ſhe will manifeſt it, in preaching him before the Saints. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, manifeſt thy love unto me by preaching and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing me, laying open the treaſures of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:118024:390"/>
that are in me, unto thoſe that hearken. Herein then lieth the performance of a great duty of the Spouſe, &amp; a ſingular declaration of her love to Chriſt, that ſhe preach him, that ſhe publiſh and lay open all the treaſures of life and glory, that be in him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That ſuch as preach the Goſpell to the Saints, muſt preach to them as to fellow Chriſtians.</hi> This implieth, that thoſe that preach to the people muſt not Lord it over them; not as to be <hi>Lords over their faith</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) <hi>but to be helpers of their joy. Paul</hi> thoughan Apoſtle, yet he was <hi>a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as in <hi>Rom. 1. 1.</hi> The Angell ſaid to <hi>John</hi> which would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe before him, <hi>See thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow-ſervant,</hi> Rev. 21. 9. Thoſe that preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell muſt preach as to fellow-members of the ſame body, companions in the faith and Spirit of Chriſt, they ſhould communicate unto them the things they have received from Chriſt, as unto brethren, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members of the ſame body.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the moſt precious treaſures of the Goſpell, ſhould be eſpecially, diſcovered and preached to the Saints.</hi> So here, the companions are ſaid to be ſuch as heare, and unto them the Spouſe is enjoyned to Preach Chriſt. It is moſt true, that the Goſpell is to be Preached to every creature under Heaven, yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Give not holy things to dogs, neither caſt Pearls before Swine.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treaſure of the Goſpell is to be communicated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the Saints, and ſuch as have a high eſteem thereof, to thoſe that have their ears boared of God, and made to heare and receive thoſe precious things. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, even to the
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:118024:391"/>
Jews a ſtumbling blocke, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſſe, but unto them which are called, both of Jews and Grecians, we preach Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdome of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 23. And againe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſamed of the Goſpell, for it is the power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto them that believe, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile,</hi> Rom. 1. 16.

                        <hi>That the Saints earneſtly deſire to be acted and carried forth by the aſſiſtance of Chriſts divine preſence.</hi> The Spouſe here deſireth that Chriſt would inable her to manifeſt his name by his haſty approach unto her, in the glorious diſeoveries of himſelfe, as upon the Mountaines of Spices; and that he would more and more manifeſt his divine preſence to her, by which ſhe might be affiſted and carried forth of all difficulties whatſoever. The Spouſe earneſtly deſireth to ſee the King in his beauty, and to ſit upon the Throne of his glory: And thus as the Song begun with a deſire of the knſſes of Chriſts mouth, ſo ſhe cocncludes alſo with a deſire of his comming in glory. Thus is the end of the <hi>Revelation. The Spirit and the Bride</hi> (even all that are faithfull) <hi>ſay come, and let him that heareth, ſay come,</hi> &amp;c. And Chriſt anſwers this requeſt, ſaying, <hi>Surely I come quickly, Amen, even ſo come Lord Jeſus,</hi> Revel. 22. 17. 20. So let the Lord come upon the Mountaine of Spices according to his good pleaſure.</p>
